Beyond Tools: Generative AI as Epistemic Infrastructure in Education,Bodong Chen,"As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures worldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet current discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic infrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI systems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on human epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following a value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation of two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their impact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for long-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems inadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster epistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that prioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the paper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in education, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while upholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes -- recommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core educational values and maintains human epistemic agency.",,2025,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06928v1,arXiv,arxiv.csv,beyond tools generative ai as epistemic infrastructure in education

Decoding The Digital Fuku: Deciphering Colonial Legacies to Critically   Assess ChatGPT in Dominican Education,Anaelia Ovalle,"Educational disparities within the Dominican Republic (DR) have long-standing origins rooted in economic, political, and social inequity. Addressing these challenges has necessarily called for capacity building with respect to educational materials, high-quality instruction, and structural resourcing. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have begun to pique the interest of Dominican educators due to their perceived potential to bridge these educational gaps. However, a substantial body of AI fairness literature has documented ways AI disproportionately reinforces power dynamics reflective of jurisdictions driving AI development and deployment policies, collectively termed the AI Global North. As such, indiscriminate adoption of this technology for DR education, even in part, risks perpetuating forms of digital coloniality. Therefore, this paper centers embracing AI-facilitated educational reform by critically examining how AI-driven tools like ChatGPT in DR education may replicate facets of digital colonialism. We provide a concise overview of 20th-century Dominican education reforms following the 1916 US occupation. Then, we employ identified neocolonial aspects historically shaping Dominican education to interrogate the perceived advantages of ChatGPT for contemporary Dominican education, as outlined by a Dominican scholar. This work invites AI Global North & South developers, stakeholders, and Dominican leaders alike to exercise a relational contextualization of data-centric epistemologies like ChatGPT to reap its transformative benefits while remaining vigilant of safeguarding Dominican digital sovereignty.",,2023,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17533v2,arXiv,arxiv.csv,decoding the digital fuku deciphering colonial legacies to critically assess chatgpt in dominican education

This study investigates how two instructors integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity, improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking. However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to pedagogically meaningful AI integration.

Connecting Feedback to Choice: Understanding Educator Preferences in   GenAI vs. Human-Created Lesson Plans in K-12 Education -- A Comparative   Analysis,"Shawon Sarkar, Min Sun, Alex Liu, Zewei Tian, Lief Esbenshade, Jian He, Zachary Zhang","As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4 model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components. We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored, particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks. Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator expertise in lesson planning.

Opinions vary widely on whether integrating AI into classrooms is the way forward or if it is detrimental to the quality of education. Increasingly, research studies are giving us more insight into the consequences of using AI tools in learning and teaching. Studies have shown how, when, and why students use AI tools. Because developments regarding the technology and its use are moving fast, we need frequent, ongoing, and more fine-grained investigation. One aspect that we do not know much about yet is how students use and think about AI across \textit{different types of education}. In this paper, we present the results of a multi-institutional survey with responses from 410 students enrolled in the computing programs of 23 educational institutions, representing high schools, colleges, and research universities. We found distinct usage patterns across the three educational institution types. Students from all types express excitement, optimism, and gratitude toward GenAI. Students in higher education more often report worry and skepticism, while high school students report greater trust and fewer negative feelings. Additionally, the AI hype has had a minimal influence, positive or negative, on high school students' decision to pursue computing. Our study contributes to a better understanding of inter-institutional differences in AI usage and perception and can help educators and students better prepare for future challenges related to AI in computing education.",10.1145/3769994.3770008,2025,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.03107v1,arXiv,arxiv.csv,excited skeptical or worried a multiinstitutional study of student views on generative ai in computing education
AI in Computational Thinking Education in Higher Education: A Systematic   Literature Review,"Ebrahim Rahimi, Clara Maathuis","Computational Thinking (CT) is a key skill set for students in higher education to thrive and adapt to an increasingly technology-driven future and workplace. While research on CT education has gained remarkable momentum in K12 over the past decade, it has remained under-explored in higher education, leaving higher education teachers with an insufficient overview, knowledge, and support regarding CT education. The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).",10.1145/3724389.3730775,2025,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09677v1,arXiv,arxiv.csv,ai in computational thinking education in higher education a systematic literature review

Visions of a Discipline: Analyzing Introductory AI Courses on YouTube,"Severin Engelmann, Madiha Zahrah Choksi, Angelina Wang, Casey Fiesler","Education plays an indispensable role in fostering societal well-being and is widely regarded as one of the most influential factors in shaping the future of generations to come. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more deeply integrated into our daily lives and the workforce, educational institutions at all levels are directing their focus on resources that cater to AI education. Our work investigates the current landscape of introductory AI courses on YouTube, and the potential for introducing ethics in this context. We qualitatively analyze the 20 most watched introductory AI courses on YouTube, coding a total of 92.2 hours of educational content viewed by close to 50 million people. Introductory AI courses do not meaningfully engage with ethical or societal challenges of AI (RQ1). When \textit{defining and framing AI}, introductory AI courses foreground excitement around AI's transformative role in society, over-exaggerate AI's current and future abilities, and anthropomorphize AI (RQ2). In \textit{teaching AI}, we see a widespread reliance on corporate AI tools and frameworks as well as a prioritization on a hands-on approach to learning rather than on conceptual foundations (RQ3). In promoting key \textit{AI practices}, introductory AI courses abstract away entirely the socio-technical nature of AI classification and prediction, for example by favoring data quantity over data quality (RQ4). We extend our analysis with recommendations that aim to integrate ethical reflections into introductory AI courses. We recommend that introductory AI courses should (1) highlight ethical challenges of AI to present a more balanced perspective, (2) raise ethical issues explicitly relevant to the technical concepts discussed and (3) nurture a sense of accountability in future AI developers.",,2024,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13077v1,arXiv,arxiv.csv,visions of a discipline analyzing introductory ai courses on youtube

This study examines conversational AI's effectiveness in supporting K-12 mathematics education across various educational contexts. Through qualitative content analysis, we identify educational contexts and key instructional needs present in educator prompts and assess AI's responsiveness. Our findings indicate that educators focus their AI conversations on assessment methods, how to set the cognitive demand level of their instruction, and strategies for making meaningful real-world connections. However, educators' conversations with AI about instructional practices do vary across revealed educational contexts; they shift their emphasis to tailored, rigorous content that addresses their students' unique needs. Educators often seek actionable guidance from AI and reject responses that do not align with their inquiries. While AI can provide accurate, relevant, and useful information when educational contexts or instructional practices are specified in conversation queries, its ability to consistently adapt responses along these evaluation dimensions varies across different educational settings. Significant work remains to realize the response-differentiating potential of conversational AI tools in complex educational use cases.

"The Interplay of Learning, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence in   Education: A Vision for Hybrid Intelligence",Mutlu Cukurova,"This paper presents a multi-dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualisation of AI as tools, as exemplified in generative AI tools, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI for achieving human-AI hybrid intelligence. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the importance of hybrid human-AI systems to extend human cognition, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research (AIED), which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualisations of AI: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human mental models, and the extension of human cognition via tightly coupled human-AI hybrid intelligence systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations in education, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition. The paper concludes with advocacy for a broader approach to AIED that goes beyond considerations on the design and development of AI, but also includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI-ubiquitous world.",,2024,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16081v4,arXiv,arxiv.csv,the interplay of learning analytics and artificial intelligence in education a vision for hybrid intelligence

AI use significantly influenced both positive and negative perceptions of AI, which in turn shaped sophisticated perspectives on STS domains - human-AI relationship, quality of life, and science and technology monopolization. Indirect effects suggest that high school science interest can influence adult perceptions of AI and STS views, mediated by science achievement and AI use. These findings provide rare empirical evidence linking secondary science education to adult engagement with AI.",,2025,arXiv: physics.ed-ph,http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.12083v1,arXiv,arxiv.csv,high school science profile predicts adults views on the future of ai and sts

Generative AI and the future of education: Ragnarök or reformation? A paradoxical perspective from management educators,"Weng Marc Lim, Asanka Gunasekara, Jessica L. Pallant, Jason Pallant, Ekaterina Pechenkina","Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has taken the world by storm, with notable tension transpiring in the field of education. Given that Generative AI is rapidly emerging as a transformative innovation, this article endeavors to offer a seminal rejoinder that aims to (i) reconcile the great debate on Generative AI in order to (ii) lay the foundation for Generative AI to co-exist as a transformative resource in the future of education. Using critical analysis as a method and paradox theory as a theoretical lens (i.e., the ""how""), this article (i) defines Generative AI and transformative education (i.e., the ""ideas""), (ii) establishes the paradoxes of Generative AI (i.e., the ""what""), and (iii) provides implications for the future of education from the perspective of management educators (i.e., the ""so what""). Noteworthily, the paradoxes of Generative AI are four-fold: (Paradox #1) Generative AI is a 'friend' yet a 'foe', (Paradox #2) Generative AI is 'capable' yet 'dependent', (Paradox #3) Generative AI is 'accessible' yet 'restrictive', and (Paradox #4) Generative AI gets even 'popular' when 'banned' (i.e., the ""what""). Through a position that seeks to embrace rather than reject Generative AI, the lessons and implications that emerge from the discussion herein represent a seminal contribution from management educators on this trending topic and should be useful for approaching Generative AI as a game-changer for education reformation in management and the field of education at large, and by extension, mitigating a situation where Generative AI develops into a Ragnarök that dooms the future of education of which management education is a part of (i.e., the ""so what"").",10.1016/j.ijme.2023.100790,2023,The International Journal of Management Education,https://openalex.org/W4322617812,OpenAlex,openalex.csv,generative ai and the future of education ragnarök or reformation a paradoxical perspective from management educators

How do we respond to generative AI in education? Open educational practices give us a framework for an ongoing process,"Anna Mills, Maha Bali, Lance Eaton","With the release of ChatGPT in November 2022, the field of higher education rapidly became aware that generative AI can complete or assist in many of the kinds of tasks traditionally used for assessment. This has come as a shock, on the heels of the shock of the pandemic. How should assessment practices change? Should we teach about generative AI or use it pedagogically? If so, how? Here, we propose that a set of open educational practices, inspired by both the Open Educational Resources (OER) movement and digital collaboration practices popularized in the pandemic, can help educators cope and perhaps thrive in an era of rapidly evolving AI. These practices include turning toward online communities that cross institutional and disciplinary boundaries. Social media, listservs, groups, and public annotation can be spaces for educators to share early, rough ideas and practices and reflect on these as we explore emergent responses to AI. These communities can facilitate crowdsourced curation of articles and learning materials. Licensing such resources for reuse and adaptation allows us to build on what others have done and update resources. Collaborating with students allows emergent, student-centered, and student-guided approaches as we learn together about AI and contribute to societal discussions about its future. We suggest approaching all these modes of response to AI as provisional and subject to reflection and revision with respect to core values and educational philosophies. In this way, we can be quicker and more agile even as the technology continues to change. We give examples of these practices from the Spring of 2023 and call for recognition of their value and for material support for them going forward. These open practices can help us collaborate across institutions, countries, and established power dynamics to enable a richer, more justly distributed emerging response to AI.",10.37074/jalt.2023.6.1.34,2023,Journal of Applied Learning & Teaching,https://openalex.org/W4380272592,OpenAlex,openalex.csv,how do we respond to generative ai in education open educational practices give us a framework for an ongoing process

The study highlights the potential of Generative AI and human-in-the loop to improve language testing by interactive assessment tasks.Deception Detection in Educational AI: Challenges for Japanese Middle School Students in Interacting with Generative AI Robots by Salem and Sumi (2024). The authors investigate whether twenty-two Japanese middle school students can detect different types of lies (lying, paltering, pandering, and bullshitting) via an anime face in contrast to a human-like face. Analyses from ten teaching sessions indicate that there are no significant differences in learning effectiveness, and in motivation and encouragement. However, most of the students are deceived. When comparing deception techniques, the bullshit technique evidenced significant differences. There is also a significant difference with regards to total belief. Exploring the Utilization and Deficiencies of Generative Artificial Intelligence in Students' Cognitive and Emotional Needs: A Systematic Mini-Review by mini-review Ortega-Ochoa et al. (2024) examines how Generative AI tools, like ChatGPT, address students' cognitive and emotional needs in educational contexts. The paper reviews four empirical works and notes challenges in scalability and generalizability, emphasizing the need for improved accuracy, personalization, and ethical integration of Generative AI to support meaningful and adaptive learning experiences. Furthermore, the paper highlights Generative AI's effectiveness in fostering engagement, emotional regulation, and instant feedback. However, it also identifies limitations, such as the inability to foster critical thinking, inconsistent response accuracy, and insufficient personalization to individual emotional and cognitive states.As a whole, this Research Topic provides interesting insights regarding the use of Generative AI in education. The papers collectively explore the multifaceted roles of generative AI in education, examining its impact on emotional engagement, academic achievement, critical thinking, personalized assessment, STEM career guidance, and ethical considerations, while also addressing the challenges and opportunities it presents in shaping the future of learning and assessment.

"Generative AI in Education: A Study of Educators' Awareness, Sentiments,
  and Influencing Factors","Aashish Ghimire, James Prather, John Edwards","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. This study delves into university instructors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towardsadoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.",10.48550/arxiv.2403.15586,2024,arXiv (Cornell University),https://openalex.org/W4393212576,OpenAlex,openalex.csv,generative ai in education a study of educators awareness sentiments and influencing factors

Reflection and Experimental Rigor Are Our AiMS: A New Metacognitive Framework for Experimental Design,"Taralyn Tan, Xiuqi Li","Experimental design is a core competency of scientific training with profound implications for research rigor and reproducibility. Yet, trainees often receive minimal guidance to structure their thinking around experimental design. Metacognition—reflecting on one's own thinking—offers a powerful tool to strengthen reasoning in this process. Here, we present the AiMS framework, which adapts the classic plan–monitor–evaluate cycle of metacognition to the context of experimental design. This framework emphasizes three iterative stages—Awareness, Analysis, and Adaptation—that scaffold reflection on an experimental system defined by its Models, Methods, and Measurements and evaluated through Specificity, Sensitivity, and Stability. We illustrate application of the AiMS framework through an interactive neuroanatomy case study and provide a structured worksheet to guide readers in applying it to their own experiments. We also highlight how the framework can assist researchers in organizing their ideas for research proposals and explore the responsible use of generative AI as a metacognitive partner that supports structured reflection without supplanting original intellectual contributions. The AiMS framework complements other principles and practices of rigor by foregrounding deliberate reasoning about assumptions, vulnerabilities, and trade-offs. Our goal is to provide practical tools that foster rigor, creativity, and adaptability in the design of biological experiments, supporting both trainees and their mentors in cultivating reflective scientific practices.",10.1523/ENEURO.0333-25.2025,2025,eNeuro,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12571498/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,reflection and experimental rigor are our aims a new metacognitive framework for experimental design
Free-Text Responses in a Nationally Representative Experimental Survey about End-of-Life Care Choices: ChatGPT-4o-Assisted Qualitative Analytical Study,"Elizabeth M Goldberg, Mario Macis, Megan Bounds, Jonathan Gomez Picazo, Lauren Hersch Nicholas","Abstract Background Little is known about how surrogates make end-of-life care choices for patients who lack the ability to make decisions for themselves. Objective The study aims (1) to identify key themes that emerged from participants’ free-text responses to a large nationally representative vignette survey about surrogate decision-making in end-of-life care and (2) to determine if an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) chatbot could assist us in accurately and efficiently performing qualitative analyses. Methods Our dataset included 3931 free-text responses from a nationally representative survey of 6109 individuals. In this qualitative study, we first familiarized ourselves with the free-text responses and hand-coded the first 200 responses until we reached saturation. We then created a codebook, initial themes, subthemes, and illustrative quotes. Subsequently, we prompted ChatGPT-4o to analyze the entire dataset of 3931 responses and identify frequent keywords and generate themes and quotable quotes. We validated responses by comparing the AI’s keyword counts to qualitative software (NVivo, Lumivero) counts and cross-validating AI-generated quotes with the original transcripts. Results We identified several key themes: surrogates more often chose comfort care for care recipients with dementia, particularly at advanced stages. They also strongly weighed the patients’ perceived quality of life and functional status. Many reported making surrogate decisions based on their own lived experiences or values, rather than making decisions aligned with the patients’ previously stated wishes. There was no significant difference between the AI and qualitative software’s keyword counts. The most frequent keywords included “life” (2051 / 81,713, 2.51%), “quality” (903 / 81,713, 1.11% ), and dementia (507 / 81,713, 0.62% ). Overall, AI-generated themes closely aligned with aforementioned human-generated themes. Manual coding of the first 200 free-text responses required 4 hours, including codebook development. In contrast, ChatGPT-4o generated themes in <10 seconds using the predefined codebook. However, dataset preparation, output verification, iterative prompting, debugging, and validation required several weeks. Conclusions Surrogates often base end-of-life decisions on dementia stage, perceived quality of life, and their own lived experiences, rather than patient preferences. Using an AI chatbot to perform qualitative analysis on free-text responses may help extend the work of qualitatively trained investigators, especially for large datasets such as free-text responses to large surveys.",10.2196/76335,2025,JMIR Aging,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12571202/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,freetext responses in a nationally representative experimental survey about endoflife care choices chatgpt4oassisted qualitative analytical study
Challenges faced by visually impaired individuals from the perspective of faculty members: a phenomenological study,Yasir Ayed Alsamiri,"Visually impaired students in higher education face significant academic, social, and psychological barriers that are often overlooked by faculty. This phenomenological study explored these challenges at Hail University, Saudi Arabia, by purposively sampling six faculty members from the Colleges of Law and Education to capture diverse disciplinary perspectives and ranks. Semi-structured interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and subjected to inductive thematic analysis with member checking and inter-rater reliability to ensure rigor. Three interrelated themes emerged: Academic Challenges—including inaccessible textbooks (lack of Braille and poorly tagged digital formats), rigid visual-based teaching methods, and absence of clear accommodation policies; Social Challenges—marked by peer ignorance, campus isolation, and exclusion from collaborative learning; and Psychological Challenges—manifested in faculty feelings of helplessness and student anxiety and low self-confidence stemming from repeated accessibility failures. Contrasting with Western models that centralize disability services, Hail University’s decentralized approach places the accommodation burden on individual faculty, underscoring the need for systemic reforms. We recommend establishing dedicated disability offices, mandating the concept of education training, launching campus-wide awareness campaigns, and integrating targeted mental-health support to foster equitable and sustainable learning environments.",10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1651597,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12571037/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,challenges faced by visually impaired individuals from the perspective of faculty members a phenomenological study
Use of and confidence in YouTube and ChatGPT in surgical teaching and training,"Stefan Tajsic, Imre Stjern-Vik, Dana Meknas, Martin Harbitz Bruusgaard","Background Today, YouTube and ChatGPT are used for a wide variety of purposes, ranging from entertainment to complex teaching. The content needs neither external approval nor quality assurance. We investigated how often doctors used YouTube and ChatGPT, how widespread their use was and the degree of confidence doctors had in these resources for teaching and training surgical procedures. Methods In November 2023, we conducted a survey among doctors working in all the surgical departments of the University Hospital of North Norway, Tromsø. The questionnaire assessed use of and confidence in YouTube and ChatGPT and background data. For our analysis, we used frequency tables and association analysis. The study formed the basis for the second-year thesis of the first authors. Results Out of a total of 152 doctors, 96 participated. Among the participants, 97% used YouTube and 14% used ChatGPT for teaching or training. There was no significant correlation between work experience and use (YouTube:  p  = 0.14, ChatGPT:  p  = 0.88). YouTube was used every month by 48%, while 2% used ChatGPT monthly. 60% of the doctors had a medium level of confidence that the content of YouTube was consistent with Norwegian procedures and standards, while 69% had low confidence in this aspect for ChatGPT. Conclusions In November 2023, there was frequent and widespread use of YouTube to teach and train surgical procedures. The ChatGPT language model was rarely used, and the doctors had low confidence in its content. The future use of online learning platforms, language models and artificial intelligence for surgery training has an uncertain potential that warrants further research.

"TEMPL: A Template-Based
Protein–Ligand Pose
Prediction Baseline","Jozef Fülöp, Martin Šícho, Wim Dehaen","Pose prediction of ligands to proteins remains a central
challenge
of structure-based drug design. Although data leakage and generalizability
concerns remain, data-driven methods for pose prediction (i.e., based
on deep learning and diffusion) now routinely outperform traditional
techniques such as molecular docking. In this work, we propose a simple
data-driven ligand-based baseline for pose prediction, which is based
on maximal common substructure to reference molecules, followed by
constrained 3D embedding. As this TEMplate-based Protein–Ligand
(TEMPL) baseline is strictly data-driven, it is a particularly meaningful
baseline for interpolative tasks, where physics-based methods sometimes
underperform as they exploit data less directly. However, it can also
highlight the added advantage of other interpolative data-driven methods
that should outperform this simple approach. We applied our baseline
method in the ASAP-Polaris-OpenADMET antiviral competition, achieving
a result that outperformed some classic docking algorithms for the
pose prediction of a series of ligands at the Main Protease of SARS-CoV-2
and MERS-CoV. Furthermore, we show that the performance of our baseline
is relatively good on a protein–ligand pose prediction benchmark
used for deep learning based pose prediction, PDBBind, highlighting
the risk of data leakage and the necessity of challenging splits for
other data-driven methods as well. We also show our baseline method
has limited performance on more challenging benchmarks, such as PoseBusters.
We provide our baseline method as open source software. For convenience
and for nontechnical users, we also provide a web application to run
the pipeline. These findings will aid in the evaluation of future
pose prediction methods, especially more complex data-driven approaches
that are increasing in popularity.",10.1021/acs.jcim.5c01985,2025,Journal of Chemical Information and Modeling,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12570141/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,templ a templatebased proteinligand pose prediction baseline
Innovative molecular intervention and precision therapy for atherosclerosis,"Zhijie Wang, Wei Peng, Linsheng Huang, Yan Zhang, Jie Yang, Xiaolin Chen, Xiang Liu, Feifeng Li, Qiong Zhang","Atherosclerosis is a chronic vascular disorder characterized by the pathological accumulation of lipids, inflammatory cells, and extracellular matrix within arterial walls. With the escalating global incidence of atherosclerosis, the development of more effective therapeutic interventions has emerged as a critical priority in biomedical research. Conventional treatment modalities, encompassing pharmacological agents and, endovascular interventions, have demonstrated partial efficacy in disease management. However, their clinical utility remains constrained by suboptimal therapeutic outcomes, treatment-related adverse effects, and instances of therapeutic failure. In response to these limitations, contemporary research has shifted focus toward novel therapeutic strategies targeting molecular pathways and immunomodulatory mechanisms, aiming to achieve enhanced precision and efficacy. This review synthesizes recent innovations in atherosclerosis therapeutics. Notable advancements include PCSK9 inhibitors and next-generation lipid-modulating agents, which have shown significant promise in clinical trials by achieving substantial reductions in atherogenic lipoprotein levels. Gene-editing technologies, particularly CRISPR-based approaches, exhibit potential for halting disease progression through targeted modulation of pro-atherogenic genes.

A LASSO-based predictive nomogram for obstructive coronary artery disease in double zero score patients: validation and cardiovascular education strategies,"Chia-Hao Liang, Yi-Chi Hung, Hsin-Hung Chen, Yun-Ju Wu, Shu-Ching Yang, Wen-Hwa Wang, Fu-Zong Wu","Background This study aimed to create a nomogram to predict a double-zero score for obstructive coronary artery disease (CAD) in a hospital-based cohort initially scoring zero. We compared its diagnostic performance with the Framingham risk score (FRS) and models for atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease (ASCVD). Methods We retrospectively reviewed the clinical features and laboratory profiles of 634 participants with baseline zero coronary artery calcium scores. The target population consisted of individuals with a double-zero score. The primary endpoint was the diagnosis of obstructive CAD, defined as CAD-RADS ≥3 or vulnerable plaque formation on the second cardiac CT. The control group had a double-zero score, with no or less than 50% coronary stenosis. We developed a nomogram using a least absolute shrinkage and selection operation-derived logistic model. We assessed the models’ discrimination and calibration abilities using the Hosmer–Lemeshow test. Results Participants were monitored for an average period of 4.26 ± 2.30 years and were randomly allocated to training and validation sets at a ratio of 2.8:1. The study results indicated that 5.13% (24 of 467) in the training cohort and 4.19% (7 of 167) in the validation cohort developed a double-zero score with obstructive CAD progression. This nomogram incorporated four predictors: “systolic blood pressure,” “hypertension,” “body fat percentage,” and “HbA1c.” The nomogram demonstrated superior diagnostic performance compared to the FRS and ASCVD models, with lower values of Akaike information criterion and Bayesian information criterion values. The nomogram's discriminative ability, measured by the area under the curve, was 0.792 in the training cohort and 0.824 in the validation cohort.

Methods Based on panel data from 21 provinces in China from 2015 to 2023, this study employs fixed-panel models, moderation effects models, and mediation effects models to examine the relationship between digital countryside construction and the sports industry, as well as its underlying mechanisms. Results Digital countryside construction exerts a significant positive promotion on the sports industry; Market-oriented factor allocation exerts a significant positive moderating influence on the impact of digital countryside construction on the sports industry; Rural consumption upgrade plays a significant positive mediating role in the influence of digital countryside construction on the sports industry. In terms of regional heterogeneity, the eastern region exhibits a significant promoting effect, while the central region shows a suppressing effect that is not statistically significant. The western region also demonstrates a promoting effect, though it is not statistically significant.

Single-cell multi-omics and machine learning for dissecting stemness in cancer,"Xinyang Huang, Shenghui Huang, Chiara Reina, Berina Šabanović, Miriam Roberto, Alexandra Aicher, Jiajia Tang, Christopher Heeschen","Abstract Cancer stem cells (CSCs) are a subpopulation of tumor cells with self-renewal capacity and the ability to drive tumor growth, metastasis, and relapse. They are widely recognized as major contributors to therapeutic resistance. Despite extensive efforts to characterize and target CSCs, their elusive nature continues to drive therapeutic resistance and relapse in epithelial malignancies. Single-cell RNA sequencing (scRNA-seq) has transformed our understanding of tumor biology. It enables high-resolution profiling of rare subpopulations (<5%) and reveals the functional heterogeneity that contributes to treatment failure. In this review, we discuss evolving evidence for a paradigm shift, enabled by rapidly advancing single-cell technologies, from a static, marker-based definition of CSCs to a dynamic and functional perspective. We explore how trajectory inference and spatial transcriptomics redefine stemness by context-dependent dynamic-state modelling. We also highlight emerging platforms, including artificial intelligence-driven predictive modelling, multi-omics integration, and functional CRISPR screens. These approaches have the potential to uncover new vulnerabilities in CSC populations.

Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM), with advantages such as broad-spectrum biological activity, low toxicity, and minimal side effects, has been widely used in drug research and development as well as disease management. Some TCMs have shown significant efficacy in treating ALI: Ganoderma lucidum polysaccharides, monoterpene glycosides from Paeonia lactiflora, glycyrrhizic acid saponins, and flavonoids all exhibit liver-protective effects; however, the protective effects of their compound preparations on liver injury remain unclear. Methods The study optimized the water extraction process using orthogonal experiments with AHP-entropy weight scoring. The preparation process was verified by single-factor experiments, Plackeett–Burman and Box–Bohnken tests. The mechanism of action was validated using network pharmacology methods and a CCl4-induced acute liver injury animal model. Results The developed extraction and granule formation processes were reliable after validation. The contents of active components in CEHG determined by HPLC were as follows: albiflorin 1.26%, paeoniflorin 5.42%, liquiritin 0.43%, glycyrrhizic acid 1.30%, and ganoderic acid A 0.14%, with batch-to-batch variation coefficients (RSD) of 1.66%, 0.87%, 2.32%, 1.60%, and 4.03%, respectively. The dry extract ratio was 18.23% with an RSD of 2.11%. Network pharmacology revealed that CEHG improved liver injury by regulating the HIF-1, p53, and FoxO signaling pathways. Animal experiments indicated that CEHG granules reduce liver function-related aspartate transaminase (AST), alanine transaminase (ALT), total cholesterol (TC), triglyceride (TG), total bilirubin (TBIL), and LDH levels, decrease the levels of inflammatory factors IL-6, IL-1β, and TNF-α and of oxidative stress-related MDA and ROS, and down-regulated the mRNA and protein levels of P53, Bax, and HIF-1α in rats with liver injury. Meanwhile, CEHG improved liver function-related Total Protein (TP), raised the levels of oxidative stress-related SOD, GSH-Px, and GSH, and up-regulated mRNA and protein expression of Bcl-2.

Comparison between 6 weeks of static stretching and resistance training programs on passive and active properties of plantar flexors. a randomized controlled trial,"Yuta Murakami, Andreas Konrad, Kazuki Kasahara, Riku Yoshida, Konstantin Warneke, David G. Behm, Masatoshi Nakamura","Introduction Resistance training (RT) and static stretching (SS) are both exercises that increase range of motion (ROM), muscle strength, and muscle mass. This study aimed to compare the effects of SS and RT and examine factors related to the increase in ROM, muscle strength, and morphology. Methods Thirty-six healthy untrained male adults (age: 21.7 ± 1.2 years) were allocated to SS, RT, or control (no intervention) groups for a 6-week intervention program. Dorsiflexion (DF) ROM, passive torque at DF ROM, passive stiffness, maximal voluntary isometric contraction (MVC-ISO), MVC concentric (MVC-CON) and MVC eccentric (MVC-ECC) torques, and muscle thickness of plantar flexors were measured before and after the intervention. Results and discussion Both SS and RT groups increased DF ROM (SS: p < 0.01, d = 0.65, RT: p = 0.038, d = 0.37) and passive torque at DF ROM (SS: p = 0.027, d = 0.64, RT: p < 0.01, d = 0.41) with similar small to moderate effect size magnitudes, while only the SS group experienced a significant, small magnitude decrease in passive stiffness (p = 0.025, d = −0.32). MVC-ISO, MVC-CON at 30°/s, and MVC-ECC torques at 30°/s showed small to large magnitude, significant increases in muscle strength (MVC-ISO at 30° plantarflexion: p < 0.01, d = 1.00, MVC-ISO at neutral position: p < 0.01, d = 0.43, MVC-ISO at 15° dorsiflexion: p < 0.01, d = 0.43, MVC-CON at 30°/s: p < 0.01, d = 0.38, MVC-ECC at 30°/s: p = 0.023, d = 0.48), whereas muscle thickness at medial and lateral gastrocnemius muscle (p < 0.001, d = 0.56 and p < 0.01, d = 0.66, respectively) exhibited significant, small magnitude increases only in the RT group. A significant positive correlation was found between the change in DF ROM and the change in passive torque at DF ROM in both SS (p < 0.001, r = 0.863) and RT (p < 0.001, r s  = 0.825) groups, but no significant correlation was found between the change in DF ROM and passive stiffness.

Explainable AI-Driven Analysis of Radiology Reports Using Text and Image Data: Experimental Study,"Muhammad Tayyab Zamir, Safir Ullah Khan, Alexander Gelbukh, Edgardo Manuel Felipe Riverón, Irina Gelbukh","Background Artificial intelligence (AI) is increasingly being integrated into clinical diagnostics; yet, its lack of transparency hinders trust and adoption among health care professionals. The explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) has the potential to improve the interpretability and reliability of AI-based decisions in clinical practice. Objective This study evaluates the use of XAI for interpreting radiology reports to improve health care practitioners’ confidence and comprehension of AI-assisted diagnostics. Methods This study used the Indiana University chest x-ray dataset containing 3169 textual reports and 6471 images. Textual data were being classified as either normal or abnormal by using a range of machine learning approaches. This includes traditional machine learning models and ensemble methods, deep learning models (long short-term memory network), and advanced transformer-based language models (GPT-2, T5, LLaMA-2, and LLaMA-3.1). For image-based classifications, convolutional neural networks, including DenseNet121 and DenseNet169, were used. Top-performing models were interpreted using XAI methods SHAP (Shapley Adaptive Explanations) and Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations to support clinical decision making by enhancing transparency and trust in model predictions. Results The LLaMA-3.1 model achieved the highest accuracy of 98% in classifying the textual radiology reports. Statistical analysis confirmed the model’s robustness, with Cohen κ (k=0.981) indicating near-perfect agreement beyond chance. Both the chi-square and Fisher exact tests revealed a highly significant association between the actual and predicted labels ( P <.001). Although the McNemar Test yielding a nonsignificant result ( P =.25) suggests a balanced class performance, the highest accuracy of 84% was achieved in the analysis of imaging data using the DenseNet169 and DenseNet121 models. To assess explainability, Local Interpretable Model-Agnostic Explanations and SHAP were applied to the best-performing models. These models consistently highlighted that the medical-related terms such as “opacity,” “consolidation,” and “pleural” are clear indications for abnormal findings in textual reports. Conclusions The research underscores that explainability is an essential component of any AI systems used in diagnostics and is helpful in the design and implementation of AI in the health care sector. Such an approach improves the accuracy of the diagnosis and builds confidence in health workers, who in the future will use XAI in clinical settings, particularly in the application of AI explainability for medical purposes.",10.2196/77482,2025,JMIR Formative Research,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12569488/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,explainable aidriven analysis of radiology reports using text and image data experimental study

Effective resistance screening across various environments is crucial to identify stable resistant genotypes with superior horticultural traits. This study aimed to investigate the resistance response of different chili genotypes and their crosses, along with their agronomic performance in diverse screening conditions. The controlled greenhouse environment enabled precise genotype screening, with AVPP-0206 and Turkey-1 demonstrating notable resistance. Screening under field conditions revealed high susceptibility in genotypes like A-132 and Wiz-21. Male fertile lines showed varying susceptibility, with Wiz-21 being highly susceptible, whereas AVPP-0206 and VRI-YP showed moderate resistance. Crosses involving resistant lines resulted in hybrids exhibiting moderate to strong resistance, while hybrids from susceptible lines showed high susceptibility.

However, integrating data into routine practice remains challenging, especially for chronic conditions such as growth disorders requiring growth hormone therapy (GHT). Integrating these data is essential to improve treatment adherence and growth outcomes in pediatric patients on GHT. Aim To explore perspectives of pediatric endocrinologists in the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) region on patient-generated health data for improving GHT adherence and identified strategies for integrating such data into clinical practice. Methods A participatory workshop was conducted on March 2, 2024, in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, using the nominal group technique. Twelve pediatric endocrinologists from the GCC region, one chairman, and two moderators participated in the session. The session centered on three clinical scenarios: GHT naïve (recently diagnosed), poorly adherent, and poor responders. Through two structured voting rounds, experts individually identified, discussed, and ranked the top five most relevant and useful patient-generated health data factors. The first round prioritized key factors, while the second round allowed participants to reassess and refine their selections to reach consensus. The final discussion focused on how identified factors could integrate into clinical practice. Results Twenty-two influencing factors were identified, representing the most relevant and useful types of patient-generated health data for integration into clinical practice. Top factors in the first ranking round included demographic data (21 points: age, income level, familiarity with technology); patient’s feelings about treatments and satisfaction (19 points); and social background (17 points: family support, insurance, caregiving responsibilities). Other considerations included reasons for missed injections and educational needs (15 points each). In the second round, social background (35 points) ranked highest, followed by injection context (34 points: timing, comfort, administration support) and patient’s feelings about treatments and satisfaction (30 points) emphasized motivational and emotional aspects of adherence. Conclusion The study highlights the significant role of social background, injection contexts, and patient satisfaction as key patient-generated health data factors for pediatric endocrinologists in the GCC region.

The influence of sex on lower limb biomechanical characteristics during single-leg drop landing in individuals with unilateral functional ankle instability,"Huizi Cui, Zilong Wang, Minjie Lin, Tao Liu, Xiangdong Wang","Objective To investigate sex differences in lower limb biomechanics during single-leg drop landing in individuals with unilateral Functional Ankle Instability (FAI). Methods Twenty individuals with unilateral FAI (10 males/10 females) performed single-leg drop landings on unstable and stable limbs respectively. Kinematic data were captured using a Vicon motion capture system, and kinetic data were collected using force plates. Data were analyzed using a 2 × 2 (Sex × Side) mixed-design ANOVA. Results Significant main effects of Sex were observed for hip flexion and abduction angles at both IC and peak vGRF, with females showing greater hip flexion ( p  = 0.005;  p  = 0.023) and smaller hip abduction ( p  = 0.026;  p  = 0.003) than males. A significant main effect of Sex was also found for ankle inversion at IC, with females exhibiting greater inversion than males ( p  = 0.005). For ankle plantarflexion at IC, a significant Sex × Side interaction was detected ( p  = 0.020); simple effects analysis revealed that females had reduced plantarflexion on the unstable side compared to their stable side ( p  = 0.010). For peak vGRF, a significant Sex × Side interaction was observed ( p  = 0.013);  post hoc  tests indicated that females had higher peak vGRF on the unstable side than males ( p  = 0.008) and their own stable side ( p  < 0.001). No significant differences were observed for knee joint angles, T_vGRF, LR, ΔL, or K leg  ( p  > 0.05). Conclusion Female individuals with FAI employ a hip-dominant compensatory strategy (increased flexion/reduced abduction) and exhibit greater ankle inversion than males. On the unstable side, they demonstrate reduced plantarflexion compared to their stable side. Males with FAI primarily adopt a joint stiffening strategy with restricted motion.

Iodine-complex directed synthesis of PbS quantum dots with enhanced electronic coupling for NIR photodetection,"Shenghui He, Guojiang Qian, Cong Zhang, Xingtian Yin, Wenxiu Que","Lead sulfide (PbS) colloidal quantum dots (CQDs) are promising materials for near-infrared (NIR) photodetection. However, conventional synthetic approaches often rely on long-chain organic ligands that impede charge transfer, necessitating complex post-synthetic ligand exchanges. Here, we introduce an Iodine-Complex Directed Synthesis (ICDS) method that enables the direct synthesis of iodide-passivated PbS-I QDs in polar solvents, thereby bypassing traditional hot-injection routes and ligand exchange processes. The PbS-I QDs demonstrated a reduction in interparticle spacing and enhanced electronic coupling, attributable to the elimination of long-chain insulating ligands. Consequently, these PbS-I QDs exhibited a photoluminescence emission peak at 1,060 nm, characterized by a distinct spectral profile indicative of efficient radiative recombination. To assess their practical applicability, the PbS-I QDs were applied in two distinct NIR photodetector architectures: sensitized photo field-effect transistors (photo-FETs) and photodiodes. The photo-FETs have demonstrated a specific detectivity of 1.63 × 10 11  Jones with rise and decay times recorded at 46.2 ms and 46.3 ms, respectively. In contrast, the photodiodes displayed superior response times, characterized by rise and decay times of 10 μs and 15 μs, respectively. These results demonstrate the effectiveness of the ICDS method in producing high-quality QDs and its potential for enabling high-speed, low-noise NIR photodetectors.",10.3389/fchem.2025.1677906,2025,Frontiers in Chemistry,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568700/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,iodinecomplex directed synthesis of pbs quantum dots with enhanced electronic coupling for nir photodetection

RPA-assisted CRISPR-Cas12a-enabled point-of-care diagnostic platform for chili leaf curl virus with fluorescent and colorimetric readouts,"Samrat Paul, Venu Emmadi, Shipra Saxena, Mehulee Sarkar, Bikash Mandal, Ravinder Kumar, Parimal Sinha, Anirban Roy","Chili leaf curl virus (ChiLCV) is a highly destructive begomovirus that causes significant economic losses in chili production across the Indian subcontinent. Accurate detection of the virus is crucial for effective disease management. This study presents a Recombinase Polymerase Amplification (RPA)-assisted DNA endonuclease-targeted CRISPR trans reporter (DETECTR) system for the rapid, highly sensitive, and specific detection of ChiLCV, specifically targeting the  AC1  gene sequence. A crRNA specific to  AC1  gene of ChiLCV- was designed, and the RPA conditions were optimized. The detection method involves cleaving a tagged oligo reporter (Fluorophore-quencher or Biotin-FAM), allowing results to be visualized via either a fluorescence read-out-based assay or a Lateral Flow Assay (LFA) with gold nanoparticles conjugated to FAM antibody. We standardized the critical concentration of the biotin-FAM oligo reporter such that, in the presence of the viral genome, the activated CRISPR-Cas12a cleaves all reporters, resulting in a dark test line on the lateral flow strip. This RPA-assisted fluorescence or LFA readout-based DETECTR system demonstrates exceptional specificity and sensitivity, detecting ChiLCV at a concentration as low as 7 femtograms when using cloned plasmid DNA, comparable to the gold standard detection method, like real-time PCR. The system successfully detected the virus in crude leaf extracts from infected plants while distinguishing ChiLCV from related begomoviruses and damage caused by common pests like mites and thrips. The DETECTR system was finally validated with field infected samples collected from major chili-growing states of India. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first demonstration of a CRISPR-based assay for ChiLCV that can be applied directly to crude leaf extracts, thereby enhancing its potential utility in point-of-care diagnostics. A key advantage of this diagnostic approach is its rapid processing time and field applicability, making it an accessible and practical tool for farmers and agricultural specialists to implement timely virus disease management strategies for chili crops.",10.3389/fmicb.2025.1644322,2025,Frontiers in Microbiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568686/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,rpaassisted crisprcas12aenabled pointofcare diagnostic platform for chili leaf curl virus with fluorescent and colorimetric readouts

First-line immune checkpoint inhibitors plus targeted therapy versus sorafenib or lenvatinib monotherapy for unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma: a meta-analysis of phase 3 trials,"Yuxuan Lin, Yonghe Liao, Bo Luo, Jinhai Shen","Background Immune checkpoint inhibitor (ICI) and targeted therapy (TT) combinations have emerged as promising first-line treatments for unresectable or advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (u/aHCC), leveraging synergistic anti-tumor effects. However, the comparative efficacy and safety of ICI-TT regimens  versus  sorafenib or lenvatinib (S/L) monotherapy require further elucidation across larger patient populations. This meta-analysis synthesizes data from phase 3 trials to evaluate the clinical benefits and risks of first-line ICI-TT combination therapy in u/aHCC. Methods We conducted systematic searches in PubMed and major oncology conference proceedings up to June 10, 2025. Eligible studies were randomized phase 3 trials comparing first-line ICI-TT  versus  S/L monotherapy in u/aHCC. Efficacy outcomes included progression-free survival (PFS), overall survival (OS) (summarized as hazard ratios [HRs] with 95% confidence intervals [CIs]), and objective response rate (ORR) (evaluated using odds ratios [ORs]). Safety outcomes assessed grade 3–5 treatment-related adverse events (TRAEs) and serious TRAEs, reported as relative risks (RRs). Results Eight phase 3 trials (IMbrave150, ORIENT-32, COSMIC-312, CARES-310, LEAP-002, SCT-I10A-C301, HEPATORCH, APOLLO) involving 4,379 patients were included. Compared with S/L monotherapy, ICI-TT combination therapy demonstrated significantly improved ORR (OR 3.93; 95% CI 2.64–5.85), PFS (HR 0.62; 95% CI 0.54–0.71), and OS (HR 0.71; 95% CI 0.62–0.82). The risk of grade 3–5 TRAEs was not significantly increased with combination therapy (RR 1.13; 95% CI 0.96–1.33). However, combination therapy was associated with a significantly higher risk of serious TRAEs (RR 1.97; 95% CI 1.50–2.60). Conclusion First-line ICI-plus-TT combination therapy demonstrates superior efficacy in ORR, PFS, and OS compared to S/L monotherapy for u/aHCC, without a significant increase in grade 3–5 TRAEs. Clinicians should be aware of the elevated risk of serious TRAEs associated with combination regimens. These findings support ICI-TT as a preferred first-line strategy for eligible patients, although individualized risk-benefit assessment remains crucial. Systematic review registration

Multivariate logistic regression analysis was employed to examine the associations between alcohol consumption patterns, ART adherence, and sexual risk-taking behaviors. Results Of the 1,501 MSM living with HIV, the prevalence of alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and binge drinking was 60.2, 24.9 and 43.6%, respectively. Multivariate logistic regression analysis revealed that alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and binge drinking were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of ART non-adherence (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 1.89, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08–3.30; aOR = 3.43, 95% CI: 2.11–5.58; aOR = 2.17, 95% CI: 1.30–3.62), having multiple sex partners (aOR = 1.62, 95% CI: 1.27–2.06; aOR = 1.49, 95% CI: 1.11–1.99; aOR = 1.65, 95% CI: 1.29–2.11), engaging in commercial sex (aOR = 2.50, 95% CI: 1.56–3.99; aOR = 3.21, 95% CI: 2.16–4.75; aOR = 3.11, 95% CI: 2.03–4.75), and participating in group sex (aOR = 1.73, 95% CI: 1.05–2.83; aOR = 1.79, 95% CI: 1.14–2.80; aOR = 1.77, 95% CI: 1.12–2.80). Alcohol use and binge drinking were associated with higher odds of casual sex (aOR = 1.31, 95% CI: 1.03–1.66; aOR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.18–1.95). Hazardous drinking and binge drinking were associated with condomless internal ejaculation (CIE) (aOR = 1.37, 95% CI: 1.03–1.83; aOR = 1.44, 95% CI: 1.11–1.86). Conclusion High levels of alcohol use, hazardous drinking, and binge drinking are observed among MSM living with HIV in Chongqing. Given the significant associations between alcohol consumption, ART non-adherence, and sexual risk-taking behaviors, public health strategies in Chongqing and similar settings may benefit from screening and interventions to address alcohol consumption among MSM living with HIV.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1629368,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568656/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,alcohol consumption patterns and risk of hiv transmission among men who have sex with men living with hiv in chongqing southwestern china
Loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials reflects trait anxiety and harm avoidance in healthy adults: an exploratory study,"Kohei Fujita, Nobuyuki Takeuchi, Shunsuke Sugiyama, Koji Inui, Yuki Fujita, Ami Yamaba, Taeko Kamiya, Takahiro Ushida, Kousuke Kanemoto, Jun Miyata, Makoto Nishihara","Loudness dependence of auditory-evoked potentials (LDAEP), a neurophysiological measure that reflects central serotonergic activity, is also influenced by the noradrenaline and dopamine systems. While it has been used in investigations of various psychiatric disorders, the fundamental characteristics in healthy individuals remain largely unknown. The present exploratory study examined 60 healthy adults to determine the associations of LDAEP with psychological traits assessed using the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI) and State-Trait Anxiety Inventory (STAI). The participants completed TCI and STAI questionnaires before undergoing electrophysiological recordings. LDAEP was measured based on the peak-to-peak amplitude slopes of P50/N100 and N100/P200 across five sound intensity levels. Using Spearman's correlation analysis, moderate negative correlations of LDAEP slopes with harm avoidance (HA) and trait anxiety (STAI-T) scores were noted. Additionally, sex-adjusted analysis showed novelty seeking to be positively associated with LDAEP. These findings suggest an association of LDAEP with individual differences in harm avoidance, trait anxiety, and novelty seeking in healthy adults. This supports the potential use of LDAEP as a non-invasive biomarker to predict treatment response in major depressive disorder, as well as in anxiety-related conditions.",10.3389/fnhum.2025.1615407,2025,Frontiers in Human Neuroscience,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568648/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,loudness dependence of auditory evoked potentials reflects trait anxiety and harm avoidance in healthy adults an exploratory study

Drought resistance of Argania spinosa L. colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus Rhizophagus irregularis varies according to accession,"Matike Ganoudi, Soumia El Malahi, Nouhaila Manan, Mohammed Ibriz, Maryline Calonne-Salmon, Stéphane Declerck","Rhizophagus irregularis  MUCL 41833 on three argan ( Argania spinosa  L. Skeels) accessions (Tidzi, Mejji, and City Hanchan) under well-watered (100% field capacity) and water-stressed (15% field capacity) conditions. Whatever the water regime, AMF colonization was observed in all accessions, but Tidzi showed significantly higher total root colonization than City Hanchan, while Mejji showed intermediate levels. Under well-watered conditions, the colonized plants exhibited higher biomass, root length, chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, and root potassium (K) concentration in all accession. In the Mejji accession, colonized plants also had significantly higher shoot concentrations of phosphorus (P) and K. Under water-stressed conditions, plant response varied with accession. Compared to their respective controls, Mejii had significantly higher biomass, shoot K concentration, chlorophyll content, stomatal conductance, and reduced oxidative stress, Tidzi had also significantly higher biomass, root P and K concentration, and chlorophyll content with lower oxidative stress, while City Hanchan had significantly higher biomass and root P concentration but had higher H 2 O 2  concentration. We can conclude that mycorrhization benefits all three accessions under stress conditions, with the Mejji and Tidzi accessions responding more favorably than the City Hanchan accession. These results highlight the role of AMF in improving argan tree performance under water-limiting conditions and demonstrate the variability in response between accessions.",10.3389/fpls.2025.1678553,2025,Frontiers in Plant Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568639/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,drought resistance of argania spinosa l colonized by the arbuscular mycorrhizal fungus rhizophagus irregularis varies according to accession
The impact of digital economy development on subjective well-being: micro-level evidence from China,"Hao Li, Jiao Li, Zihan Yang","Introduction In the era of digital transformation, exploring the welfare implications of societal changes and in particular the relationship between digital economy development and subjective well-being (SWB) has emerged as a critical focus of academic research. Clarifying how digital economy development affects SWB and its underlying mechanisms is essential for improving societal welfare and quality of life in the context of digitalization. Methods This study employs empirical analysis to address the research gap. It combines two types of data: 1) micro-level data from the China Family Panel Studies (CFPS) covering the years 2018, 2020, and 2022; and 2) macro-level metrics of regional digital economy development. The integrated dataset is used to examine the impact of digital economy development on SWB and identify its intrinsic mechanisms. Results Digital economy development significantly enhances residents’ SWB, with key transmission channels including the popularization of digital applications, improved information acquisition capabilities, and optimized digital living environments; meanwhile, heterogeneous regression analyses reveal that the positive impact of digital economy development on SWB varies significantly by age and frequency of digital technology usage, and mediation effect tests further confirm that the digital economy influences SWB primarily through five pathways, namely economic improvement, health enhancement, life quality upgrading, environmental optimization, and governance efficiency improvement. Discussion Strengthening the construction of digital infrastructure, establishing tiered intervention mechanisms to address heterogeneous impacts across age and usage frequency groups, developing dynamic evaluation systems for digital economy welfare effects, and building a new digital governance paradigm that balances efficiency and fairness are targeted recommendations. These measures aim to fully leverage the welfare-enhancing role of the digital economy, ultimately promoting overall societal welfare and improving residents’ quality of life.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1660857,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568634/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,the impact of digital economy development on subjective wellbeing microlevel evidence from china
Research progress of rebound pain after nerve block in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair,"Xue Yang, Yujiao Yang, Sulan Qin, Yunliang Chen","Arthroscopic rotator cuff repair (ARCR) is a commonly performed surgical intervention for rotator cuff injuries. The advent of ultrasound guidance has facilitated the widespread adoption of nerve blocks as an adjunct anesthetic and analgesic strategy in the perioperative phase of ARCR, offering notable benefits in maintaining patients' intraoperative hemodynamic stability and reducing opioid consumption. Despite the minimally invasive nature of ARCR, a subset of patients still experiences substantial pain, encompassing both acute pain and rebound pain following nerve block. Post-nerve block rebound pain is characterized by severe and disabling discomfort, which adversely impacts the patient experience and postoperative recovery. The mechanism underlying rebound pain after nerve block may involve aberrant excitation of relevant nerve fibers, the pharmacology of local anesthetics, nerve injury, local inflammatory factors, surgical anesthesia, and patient-specific variability. The review suggests that the incidence of post-nerve block rebound pain can be reduced, and postoperative pain management outcomes following ARCR can be improved, through interventions such as continuous nerve block, combined peripheral nerve block, administration of local anesthetic adjuvants, multimodal analgesia, and patient education.",10.3389/fmed.2025.1659133,2025,Frontiers in Medicine,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568624/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,research progress of rebound pain after nerve block in arthroscopic rotator cuff repair
Coping tendencies play partial mediating role between social support and anxiety/depression among Chinese keloid patients,"Yuting Huang, Shu Xu, Yuqi Wu, Zhifeng Gu, Chen Dong, Li Zhang, Xiaodong Chen","Background In addition to producing pain and itching, keloids can cause psychological symptoms, including anxiety and depression. We aimed to investigate the prevalence and underlying factors of anxiety/depression in Chinese keloid patients and to explore the mediating role between social support and anxiety/depression. Methods A total of 202 self-reported questionnaires were collected from keloid patients, including the General Information Questionnaire, Vancouver Scar Assessment Scale (VSS), Patient and Observer Scar Assessment Scale (POSAS), Dermatological Problems Quality of Life Inventory (DLQI), Social Support Rating Scale (SSRS), Simple Coping Styles Scale (SCSQ), Self-Efficacy Scale (GSES) and the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale (HADS). Results The mean scores for anxiety and depression were 9.82 ± 2.20 and 7.96 ± 2.70, respectively. Annual income (OR = 0.258), GSES score (OR = 0.2955), pain symptoms (OR = 1.281) and coping styles (OR:3.321) were significantly associated with HADS anxiety in keloid patients (P<0.05), whereas use of support (OR = 0.607) was significantly associated with HADS depression in keloid patients (p<0.05). The area under the curve (AUC) for the combined anxiety ROC for annual income, coping styles, pain symptoms and GSES scores was 0.835. PROCESS analysis concluded that coping tendencies partially mediated the relationship between social support and depression, with the mediating effect accounting for 38.58% of the total effect. Conclusion Coping tendency in keloid patients played a partial mediating role between social support and depression.

"Videos on YouTube, Bilibili, TikTok as sources of medical information on Hashimoto’s thyroiditis","Shiqi Wang, Siyu Jia, Yanjun Su, Ruochuan Cheng","Introduction Hashimoto’s thyroiditis (HT), a common autoimmune thyroid disorder, is widely discussed on video-sharing platforms. However, user-generated content about HT lacks systematic scientific validation. This study evaluates the reliability and quality of HT-related videos on three major social media platforms: YouTube, Bilibili, and TikTok. Methods Between December 1, 10, 2024, the top 200 videos meeting the criteria retrieved under default search settings using a newly registered user account were included for each platform. These videos were from 107 YouTube accounts, 56 Bilibili accounts and 90 TikTok accounts. Metrics including video parameters and creator profiles were recorded. Content quality was evaluated using five validated assessment tools: PEMAT (Patient Education Materials Assessment Tool), VIQI (Video Information and Quality Index), GQS (Global Quality Score), mDISCERN (modified DISCERN), and JAMA (Journal of the American Medical Association) standards. Results TikTok videos showed the highest audience engagement. YouTube had more team-based accounts (43.9%), while TikTok and Bilibili predominantly featured individual accounts, with TikTok featuring a notably higher proportion of verified individual accounts (86.7%). Solo narration was the most common video style across YouTube (62.5%) and TikTok (70.0%), while in Bilibili, it was the medical scenario. In contrast, YouTube and Bilibili offered a broader range of content, including TV programs, documentaries, and educational courses. The varying emphases of different assessment tools rendered it difficult to determine which platform boasts the highest content quality, but the video quality scores across all platforms are not satisfying. Additionally, we found that content produced by verified creators was of higher quality compared to that of unverified creators, with this trend being particularly evident among individual accounts. Conclusion Social media platforms provide partial support for the dissemination of health information about HT, but the overall video quality remains suboptimal. We recommend that professional creators pursue platform certification to enhance the dissemination of high-quality HT-related videos.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1611087,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568602/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,videos on youtube bilibili tiktok as sources of medical information on hashimotos thyroiditis
The relationship between tobacco and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease incidence: a systematic review and meta-analysis of observational studies,"Jianxiang Jin, Yuping Zhang, Yiping Huang","Background This meta-analysis investigates the relationship between smoking and non-alcoholic fatty liver disease (NAFLD) risk. Methods Observational studies (cohort, case-control, cross-sectional) were systematically searched in PubMed, Web of Science, EBSCO, and Cochrane Library up to December 2024. Adjusted odds ratio (OR) and corresponding 95% confidence interval (95% CI) were used to assess the association. Results A total of 19 studies, composing 450,130 participants were included. Active smoking significantly increased NAFLD risk (OR = 1.30, 95% CI: 1.21–1.40,  p  < 0.001), with stronger effects observed in current smokers (OR = 1.41, 95% CI: 1.22–1.63,  p  < 0.001). A dose-response relationship was evident: ≥20 pack-years of smoking elevated risk by 32% (OR = 1.32, 95% CI: 1.18–1.49,  p  < 0.001). Subgroup analyses revealed amplified risks in metabolically compromised individuals, including those with BMI ≥ 24 (OR = 1.43,  p  < 0.001), TG ≥ 1.2 mmol/L (OR = 1.41,  p  = 0.003), and SBP ≥ 125 mmHg (OR = 1.65,  p  < 0.001). Passive smoking showed a marginal association (OR = 1.13, 95% CI: 1.09–1.16,  p  < 0.001). Conclusion Smoking is an independent risk factor for NAFLD, particularly in individuals with metabolic dysregulation. Public health strategies targeting smoking cessation and metabolic control may mitigate NAFLD burden.

Effects of 12 weeks of fascia knife release therapy in combination with exercise for treating neck and shoulder pain in adolescent table tennis players,"Li Yunqing, Zhang Shinian, Li Jie, Wu Xianfeng","Background We investigated whether fascia knife release therapy combined with exercise for treating neck and shoulder pain administered over a period of 12 weeks enhanced the visual analog scale (VAS), cervical muscle endurance test (CMET) score and neck disability index (NDI) score in adolescent table tennis players. Methods This study adopted a prospective, exploratory design with a small sample size. The sample size was determined on the basis of the minimum requirements suggested by the relevant literature and feasibility considerations. Accounting for a potential 10% attrition rate, the study ultimately enrolled 40 adolescent table tennis players who were randomized to a control group or treatment group during the recovery period at the Anhui Sports Rehabilitation Clinic (Hefei, Anhui, China) in 2024. The subjects were divided into a medication group ( n  = 20, control group; CON) and a fascia knife release therapy combined with exercise group ( n  = 20, experimental group; EXP). A recovery exercise was applied to the control group for 12 weeks, whereas fascia knife release therapy combined with exercise was applied to the treatment group within the recovery empty period. The visual analog scale (VAS), cervical muscle endurance test (CMET) and neck disability index (NDI) were used to assess recovery before and after 12 weeks. Results Comparisons of the visual analog scale ( p  = 0.854), cervical muscle endurance test ( p  = 0.393) and neck disability indices ( p  = 0.828) scores revealed no statistically significant differences between the CON group and the EXP group before the intervention. Compared with the control group, the EXP group presented significantly lower VAS ( p  = 0.001) and NDI ( p  = 0.001) scores following 12 weeks of fascia knife release therapy combined with exercise. There was a statistically significant increase in CMET in the treatment group ( p  = 0.001) compared with that in the CON group. Conclusion Fascia knife release therapy combined with functional exercise enhances cervical muscle endurance (CMET) while significantly reducing pain (VAS) and functional disability (NDI) in adolescent table tennis players with neck and shoulder pain. Thus, this combined approach not only addresses immediate symptoms but also strengthens the muscles around the neck and shoulders, providing improved support and stability.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1679219,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568588/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,effects of 12 weeks of fascia knife release therapy in combination with exercise for treating neck and shoulder pain in adolescent table tennis players

Methods This cross-sectional study analyzed 834 fundus images from 417 children (age 8–9 years), including 123 highland children (HLC) and 294 lowland children (LLC). Fundus photography was performed using a non-mydriatic 45° fundus camera. Automated image analysis quantified: (1) retinal vascular parameters (fractal dimension [VDf], caliber [VC], tortuosity [VT], density [VD], branching angle [VBA], and arteriole-to-venule ratio [AVR]); and (2) optic nerve head morphology (disc area, cup area, and cup-to-disc ratio [C/D]). Group comparisons of all parameters were conducted using AI-based analytical methods. Results After adjusting for age, sex, and axial length (AXL), covariance analysis demonstrated that the HLC group showed significantly smaller VC (p = 0.005) and VBA (p = 0.003), along with larger optic cup and disc areas (p < 0.001) compared to the LLC group. Both peripapillary VD and VC exhibited a progressive decrease with increasing distance from the optic disc border. Moreover, the HLC group demonstrated a significantly lower VC compared to the LLC group (p = 0.005). Furthermore, the HLC group displayed: (1) significantly higher VD in the inferior quadrant (p < 0.001), (2) increased VT in both nasal and temporal quadrants (p < 0.001 for both), (3) decreased VC in superior (p < 0.001), inferior (p = 0.005), and nasal (p = 0.001) quadrants, and (4) reduced VDf in the nasal quadrant (p = 0.001) of peripapillary regions compared to the LLC group.

Mitochondrial genome of Isatis indigotica reveals repeat-mediated recombination and phylogenetic insights in Cruciferae,"Shaoshuai Yu, Meiling Qin, Emmanuel Fleming, Xun Gong, Min Tang","Isatis indigotica  is an important medicinal plant extensively used in traditional Chinese medicine for its antiviral and anti-inflammatory properties. While previous studies have elucidated its nuclear and plastid genomes, the mitochondrial genome (mitogenome) —critical for understanding organellar evolution, intracellular DNA transfer, and stress response mechanisms—has remained uncharacterized. Here, we present a complete  de novo  assembly and comprehensive analysis of the  I. indigotica  mitogenome, generated using high-fidelity long-read sequencing technologies. The circular mitogenome spans 260,864 bp and encodes 31 protein-coding genes, 21 transfer RNAs, and 3 ribosomal RNAs. Repetitive sequences constitute 12.3% of the genome, with large repeats mediating homologous recombination and generating alternative conformations. A total of 488 RNA editing sites were identified, predominantly of the cytidine-to-uridine (C-to-U) type, indicating extensive post-transcriptional modification. We also detected 36 regions homologous to the plastid genome, reflecting active inter-organellar DNA transfer. Codon usage analysis revealed a preference for A/U-ending codons, and Ka/Ks analysis suggested strong purifying selection in most mitochondrial genes. Phylogenomic analysis based on 24 conserved mitochondrial genes placed  I. indigotica  in close proximity to  Brassica  species, supporting its taxonomic placement within the Brassicaceae family and aligning with plastid-based phylogenies. This study provides the first complete mitogenome of  I. indigotica , offering valuable insights into mitogenome architecture, RNA editing dynamics, and plastid–mitochondrial interactions, while contributing to broader evolutionary and genomic understanding of cruciferous medicinal plants.",10.3389/fpls.2025.1655810,2025,Frontiers in Plant Science,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568568/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,mitochondrial genome of isatis indigotica reveals repeatmediated recombination and phylogenetic insights in cruciferae
Evaluation of the intraventricular hemodynamics of patients with left ventricular dysfunction via vector flow mapping,"Qun Xu, Li Hao, Guang Yang, Mei Zhang, Mingxue Di","Background Vorticity, measured via new vector flow mapping (VFM), a quantitative marker of vortex dynamics, can reflect hemodynamic changes more sensitively, potentially offering complementary information to conventional echocardiographic indices of cardiac function. Aims We investigated left ventricular hemodynamics in both normal subjects and patients with left ventricular dysfunction to explore the probability of evaluating cardiac function with the assistant index, the highest vorticity value of a vortex (Vort-max). Methods Sixty subjects were divided into 3 groups, namely, the control group, Group I (HFpEF) and Group II (HFmrEF&HFrEF), and examined via conventional echocardiography. VFM was performed from the apical 5-chamber view to calculate the vorticity during diastole and systole in the left ventricle. Results Hemodynamic changes were obvious during diastolic dysfunction. The Vort-max-base values of early and late diastole in Group I were greater than those in the control groups ( P  < 0.001). The Vort-max-apex of mid-systole in Group I was greater than that in the control group ( P  = 0.044). Vort-max-base in early diastole, Vort-max in all three segments in mid-diastole, Vort-max-apex and Vort-max-middle in late diastole, were associated with  E / e ′ and  E  ( P  < 0.05). Vort-max-middle and Vort-max-base in all three segments in late diastole was associated with A ( P  < 0.05).

Correlates of perceived social unacceptability of vaping among regular e-cigarette users: a cross-sectional study of a sample of Middle Eastern countries,"Hissa Mohamed AlMuraikhi, Fatima Al Zahraa Chokor, Mohammed Al-Hamdani","Aim To examine the association between the social unacceptability of vaping and the main correlate, country of residence, as well as other sociodemographic variables in three Middle Eastern countries. Methods A cross-sectional online survey study of a convenience sample of regular vapers in Middle Eastern countries was recruited. Recruitment took place through paid advertisements on social media, regular e-cigarette users, completed an online survey. Vapers responded to socio-demographic and social unacceptability questions. Ordinal logistic regression was used for analysis. Results N =  428 vapers completed the survey. Male vapers and vapers who currently smoke had lower odds for social unacceptability perceptions relative to females and never smoker counterparts. Vapers in Qatar, experiencing pressure to vape from friends, encountering negative effects, and mod and e-cigarette use was associated with higher odds of social unacceptability perceptions relative to vapers in Egypt, not experiencing pressure from friends, not encountering negative effects, and pod use, respectively. Conclusion Relative to vapers in Egypt, those in Qatar reported higher social unacceptability levels, likely due to restrictive legislations, and calls for similar restrictions in Egypt. More awareness is needed to increase social unacceptability among vapers who are males and current smokers. Highlighting potential negative effects from vaping in education campaigns and regulatory restrictions on pod design (compact, sleek, and concealable features) may help increase the social unacceptability of vaping.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1620863,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568529/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,correlates of perceived social unacceptability of vaping among regular ecigarette users a crosssectional study of a sample of middle eastern countries
When emotion meets reason: the development and validation of EpiCT-CI scale to measure epistemic emotions in critical thinking application and cultural identity constructions,Yue Peng,"Introduction Epistemic emotion is a significant concept in education, but traditional scales rarely focus on the status of epistemic emotions in intercultural issues. Additionally, cultural identity and critical thinking are vital in navigating the complexities inherent in intercultural contexts. Existing measures of critical thinking and cultural identity seldom consider the influence of emotions. The EpiCT-CI Scale, developed in this research, seeks to bridge this gap by measuring how epistemic emotions influence critical thinking and cultural identity in intercultural settings. Method Developing and validating the EpiCT-CI Scale combines qualitative and quantitative methods. Study 1 collected data from students’ comments, judgments, and narrations about critical thinking during COVID-19. Study 2 focused on the emotional experiences of constructing cultural identity by reading, analyzing, and writing about cultural issues. The data from Studies 1 and 2 are analyzed in NVivo 15.0. The original EpiCT-CI Scale is validated through SPSS 20.0 and Amos 29.0 in Study 3. Results The results from Studies 1 and 2 indicate that epistemic emotions are a blend of neutral, positive, and negative states, rather than simple linear progressions. The initial 52-item scale underwent a thorough evaluation, modification, and validation process in Study 3, resulting in a four-dimensional 19-item EpiCT-CI Scale, which represents four groups of epistemic emotions: joy in critical cultural inquiry, boredom in critical cultural reflection, curiosity in cultural identity reflection, and distress in cultural adaptation. The EpiCT-CI Scale provides an effective tool for assessing epistemic emotions in cultural identity constructions and critical thinking applications.",10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1687003,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568516/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,when emotion meets reason the development and validation of epictci scale to measure epistemic emotions in critical thinking application and cultural identity constructions
Caring task-involving climate leads to greater improvements in free-throw shooting biomechanics and motivational responses,"Candace M. Hogue, Dimitrije Cabarkapa, Mary D. Fry, Andrew C. Fry, Troy O. Wineinger, Jacob M. Chamberlin","Introduction There is a need for experimental and cross-disciplinary research in sport psychology, particularly studies that incorporate objective performance assessments into motivational climate research. Methods This investigation examined biomechanical changes in athletes’ free-throw shooting form in response to the motivational climate during a basketball clinic, as well as affect, demand and resource appraisals, and motivational outcomes. Thirty-nine male basketball players were assigned to a free-throw clinic with either a caring, task-involving (CTI) climate, where high effort and improvement are valued and recognized and mistakes are part of learning or an ego-involving (EI) climate, where winning is prioritized, athletes are punished for mistakes, and star players are favored. Participants completed pre- and post-clinic surveys. Video analysis allowed for the assessment of free-throw kinematics (e.g., knee flexion) pre- and post-clinic. Results No baseline group differences were found. At post-assessment, the CTI group’s shooting kinematics more closely resembled those of proficient shooters compared to the EI group. Individuals in the EI climate perceived the clinic as more demanding and reported a significant increase in negative affect. In contrast, CTI participants reported significantly greater positive affect, effort, and interest and excitement to continue practicing. Discussion Findings suggest creating a CTI climate can enhance motivation and facilitate player development.",10.3389/fpsyg.2025.1667429,2025,Frontiers in Psychology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568460/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,caring taskinvolving climate leads to greater improvements in freethrow shooting biomechanics and motivational responses
"Gut microbiota, nutrients, and depression","Yajun Qiao, Lin Rong, Hanxi Chen, Juan Guo, Guoqiang Li, Qiannan Wang, Hongtao Bi, Lixin Wei, Tingting Gao","In the post-COVID-19 era, depression incidence has risen sharply, and a healthy diet is confirmed to lower this risk. However, two critical gaps remain: it is unclear whether nutrients alleviate depressive symptoms by improving the gut microbiota, and existing evidence has notable limitations. This study aimed to address these by exploring how deficiencies in key nutrients (protein, lipids, sugars, vitamins, and minerals) affect gut microbiota diversity—potentially a driver of early depression—and systematically evaluating clinical/basic research on nutrients' role in gut microbiota-mediated depression intervention. Results showed nutrients enhance gut microbiota abundance and diversity, regulate the gut-brain axis to boost short-chain fatty acid (SCFA) and neurotransmitter synthesis, and reduce inflammation, thereby alleviating depression. Thus, a healthy anti-inflammatory diet (rich in vegetables, fruits, fish) may lower depressive symptom risk. Three key research gaps were identified: 1. Mechanistic evidence relies heavily on animal studies (e.g., mouse neurotransmitter experiments) with insufficient large-scale human randomized controlled trials (RCTs) to confirm causality; 2. Conflicting findings exist [e.g., alpha-linolenic acid (ALA) has no antidepressant effect in some human cohorts]; 3. The dose-response relationship (e.g., fiber needed to elevate SCFAs to antidepressant levels) is unquantified. Future studies should quantify dietary patterns and target gut microbiota metabolism to advance early depression prevention and deepen understanding of diet-microbiota-depression links.",10.3389/fnut.2025.1581848,2025,Frontiers in Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568435/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,gut microbiota nutrients and depression
Analysis of current status and influencing factors of participation in medication safety behaviors among older adult patients with chronic co-morbidities: based on the COM-B model,"Yuxin Li, Lin He, Tianxia Zhao, Ping Dai, Yanhong Wen, Yuting Fan, Qin Lin, Jijun Wu","Background With the acceleration of global aging, the prevention and control of chronic disease comorbidity have become increasingly challenging, emerging as a significant global public health issue. Patients with multiple coexisting conditions often face complex treatment regimens and multiple medications, posing significant challenges to their participation in medication safety behaviors. Individual health behaviors are influenced by knowledge, beliefs, and social environment, among other factors. Therefore, this study employs the COM-B model to analyse the factors influencing participation in medication safety behaviors among older adult patients with chronic coexisting conditions, aiming to provide insight into participation in medication safety behaviors. Methods This cross-sectional study employed convenience sampling to survey 335 older adult patients with chronic disease comorbidity at a Grade A tertiary hospital in Sichuan Province, China, from July to December 2024. The survey employed a general information questionnaire, the participation in medication safety behaviors scale, the health literacy scale, the medication belief scale, the family APGAR questionnaire, and the social network scale. Descriptive analysis, univariate analysis, correlation analysis, and multiple linear regression analysis were conducted using SPSS 26.0 software. Results The mean participation in medication safety behaviors score among 335 older adult patients with chronic comorbidities was 101.36 ± 16.68. Correlation analysis revealed that the total score and individual dimension scores of participation in medication safety behaviors among older adult patients with chronic comorbidities were positively correlated with the total scores of health literacy, medication belief, family function, and social network ( r  = 0.347–0.703,  p  < 0.01). Multivariate linear regression analysis revealed that education level, drug concerns, disease knowledge level, health literacy, medication belief, family function, and social network were significant predictors in the regression equation ( p  < 0.05), accounting for 75.5% of the total variance. Conclusion Chinese older adult patients with chronic disease comorbidity demonstrate moderate participation in medication safety behaviors. Education level, drug concerns, disease knowledge level, health literacy, medication belief, family function, and social network are key determinants influencing medication safety behaviors among this population. The COM-B model provides a framework for explaining low participation in medication safety behaviors among older adult patients with chronic disease comorbidities and guides the development of targeted health intervention strategies.",10.3389/fpubh.2025.1695668,2025,Frontiers in Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568423/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,analysis of current status and influencing factors of participation in medication safety behaviors among older adult patients with chronic comorbidities based on the comb model
Comprehensive analyses of single-cell and bulk RNA-seq reveal the biological and prognostic roles of BMP4 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma,"Ao Wang, Xinglong Shen, Shan Lu, Chao Bi, Yang Cao, Yunfeng Liu, Meng Li, Yun Zhao, Huaizhang Jin, Xiaopeng Shen, Wei Dai, Yang Lei","Bone Morphogenetic Protein 4 ( BMP4 ) plays a critical role in development, but its function in pancreatic adenocarcinoma (PAAD) is not well understood. We found that  BMP4  is minimally expressed in the normal pancreas but markedly upregulated in PAAD, correlating with poor patient survival. Pan-cancer analysis revealed distinct expression and prognostic patterns of  BMP4 , while pathway analyses indicated that  BMP4  predominantly regulates metabolic rather than canonical BMP signaling. Single-cell RNA-seq showed  BMP4  enrichment in cancer cells and cancer stem cells, supporting its role in tumor metabolism. Importantly,  BMP4  was identified as an independent prognostic factor for PAAD, and a nomogram incorporating  BMP4  accurately predicted patient outcomes. Although  BMP4  affected certain immune cell infiltrations, its prognostic impact was largely independent of immune modulation. Collectively, these findings highlight  BMP4  as a potential biomarker and therapeutic target in PAAD.",10.3389/fmolb.2025.1686938,2025,Frontiers in Molecular Biosciences,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12568421/,PubMed,pubmed.csv,comprehensive analyses of singlecell and bulk rnaseq reveal the biological and prognostic roles of bmp4 in pancreatic adenocarcinoma
