"Generative AI in Education: A Study of Educators' Awareness, Sentiments,   and Influencing Factors","Aashish Ghimire, James Prather, John Edwards","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. This study delves into university instructors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towardsadoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.",,2024,arXiv: cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15586v1,arXiv

Integrating Generative AI into LMS: Reshaping Learning and Instructional   Design,"Xinran Zhu, Liam Magee, Peg Mischler","Education in the era of generative AI faces a pivotal transformation. As AI systems reshape professional practices-from software development to creative design-educators must reconsider how to prepare students for a future where humans and machines co-construct knowledge. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude automate tasks and personalize learning, their educational potential depends on how meaningfully they are integrated into learning environments. This paper argues that Learning Management Systems (LMSs), as the core of educational practice, must evolve from static content repositories into dynamic ecosystems that cultivate higher-order thinking and meaningful human-AI interaction. We propose two guiding principles for integrating generative AI into LMSs. First, From Content Delivery to Fostering Higher-Order Thinking, emphasizing AI's role in supporting inquiry, collaboration, and reflective knowledge building. Second, Toward Meaningful Interaction with AI, highlighting the design of learning environments that nurture critical, intentional, and socially mediated engagement with AI. Drawing on a case study of CheckIT Learning, we illustrate how these principles can translate into practice.

Beyond Tools: Generative AI as Epistemic Infrastructure in Education,Bodong Chen,"As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures worldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet current discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic infrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI systems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on human epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following a value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation of two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their impact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for long-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems inadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster epistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that prioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the paper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in education, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while upholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes -- recommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core educational values and maintains human epistemic agency.",,2025,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06928v1,arXiv

Decoding The Digital Fuku: Deciphering Colonial Legacies to Critically   Assess ChatGPT in Dominican Education,Anaelia Ovalle,"Educational disparities within the Dominican Republic (DR) have long-standing origins rooted in economic, political, and social inequity. Addressing these challenges has necessarily called for capacity building with respect to educational materials, high-quality instruction, and structural resourcing. Generative AI tools like ChatGPT have begun to pique the interest of Dominican educators due to their perceived potential to bridge these educational gaps. However, a substantial body of AI fairness literature has documented ways AI disproportionately reinforces power dynamics reflective of jurisdictions driving AI development and deployment policies, collectively termed the AI Global North. As such, indiscriminate adoption of this technology for DR education, even in part, risks perpetuating forms of digital coloniality. Therefore, this paper centers embracing AI-facilitated educational reform by critically examining how AI-driven tools like ChatGPT in DR education may replicate facets of digital colonialism. We provide a concise overview of 20th-century Dominican education reforms following the 1916 US occupation. Then, we employ identified neocolonial aspects historically shaping Dominican education to interrogate the perceived advantages of ChatGPT for contemporary Dominican education, as outlined by a Dominican scholar. This work invites AI Global North & South developers, stakeholders, and Dominican leaders alike to exercise a relational contextualization of data-centric epistemologies like ChatGPT to reap its transformative benefits while remaining vigilant of safeguarding Dominican digital sovereignty.",,2023,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2310.17533v2,arXiv
Empowering Educators in the Age of AI: An Empirical Study on Creating   custom GPTs in Qualitative Research Method education,"Qian Huang, Thijs Willems","As generative AI (Gen-AI) tools become more prevalent in education, there is a growing need to understand how educators, not just students, can actively shape their design and use. This study investigates how two instructors integrated four custom GPT tools into a Masters-level Qualitative Research Methods course for Urban Planning Policy students. Addressing two key gaps: the dominant framing of students as passive AI users, and the limited use of AI in qualitative methods education. The study explores how Gen-AI can support disciplinary learning when aligned with pedagogical intent. Drawing on the Technological Pedagogical Content Knowledge (TPACK) framework and action research methodology, the instructors designed GPTs to scaffold tasks such as research question formulation, interview practice, fieldnote analysis, and design thinking. Thematic analysis of student reflections, AI chat logs, and final assignments revealed that the tools enhanced student reflexivity, improved interview techniques, and supported structured analytic thinking. However, students also expressed concerns about cognitive overload, reduced immersion in data, and the formulaic nature of AI responses. The study offers three key insights: AI can be a powerful scaffold for active learning when paired with human facilitation; custom GPTs can serve as cognitive partners in iterative research practice; and educator-led design is critical to pedagogically meaningful AI integration. This research contributes to emerging scholarship on AI in higher education by demonstrating how empowering educators to design custom tools can promote more reflective, responsible, and collaborative learning with AI.",,2025,"arXiv: cs.HC, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2507.21074v1,arXiv

Higher education's ethos of collaborative faculty governance, pedagogical and research goals, and embrace of academic freedom conflict, the paper argues, with centralized top down approaches to governing AI that are common in the private sector. The paper is based on a semester long effort at the University of Pittsburgh which gathered and organized perspectives on generative AI in higher education through a collaborative, iterative, interdisciplinary process that included recurring group discussions, three standalone focus groups, and an informal survey. The paper presents insights drawn from this effort that give rise to the ''points to consider'' approach the paper develops. These insights include the benefits and risks of potential uses of generative AI In higher education, as well as barriers to its adoption, and culminate in the six normative points to consider when adopting and governing generative AI in institutions of higher education.",10.1145/3630106.3659023,2024,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2406.01930v1,arXiv
Connecting Feedback to Choice: Understanding Educator Preferences in   GenAI vs. Human-Created Lesson Plans in K-12 Education -- A Comparative   Analysis,"Shawon Sarkar, Min Sun, Alex Liu, Zewei Tian, Lief Esbenshade, Jian He, Zachary Zhang","As generative AI (GenAI) models are increasingly explored for educational applications, understanding educator preferences for AI-generated lesson plans is critical for their effective integration into K-12 instruction. This exploratory study compares lesson plans authored by human curriculum designers, a fine-tuned LLaMA-2-13b model trained on K-12 content, and a customized GPT-4 model to evaluate their pedagogical quality across multiple instructional measures: warm-up activities, main tasks, cool-down activities, and overall quality. Using a large-scale preference study with K-12 math educators, we examine how preferences vary across grade levels and instructional components. We employ both qualitative and quantitative analyses. The raw preference results indicate that human-authored lesson plans are generally favored, particularly for elementary education, where educators emphasize student engagement, scaffolding, and collaborative learning. However, AI-generated models demonstrate increasing competitiveness in cool-down tasks and structured learning activities, particularly in high school settings. Beyond quantitative results, we conduct thematic analysis using LDA and manual coding to identify key factors influencing educator preferences. Educators value human-authored plans for their nuanced differentiation, real-world contextualization, and student discourse facilitation. Meanwhile, AI-generated lesson plans are often praised for their structure and adaptability for specific instructional tasks. Findings suggest a human-AI collaborative approach to lesson planning, where GenAI can serve as an assistive tool rather than a replacement for educator expertise in lesson planning. This study contributes to the growing discourse on responsible AI integration in education, highlighting both opportunities and challenges in leveraging GenAI for curriculum development.",,2025,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.05449v1,arXiv

AI Literacy for All: Adjustable Interdisciplinary Socio-technical   Curriculum,"Sri Yash Tadimalla, Mary Lou Maher","This paper presents a curriculum, ""AI Literacy for All,"" to promote an interdisciplinary understanding of AI, its socio-technical implications, and its practical applications for all levels of education. With the rapid evolution of artificial intelligence (AI), there is a need for AI literacy that goes beyond the traditional AI education curriculum. AI literacy has been conceptualized in various ways, including public literacy, competency building for designers, conceptual understanding of AI concepts, and domain-specific upskilling. Most of these conceptualizations were established before the public release of Generative AI (Gen-AI) tools like ChatGPT. AI education has focused on the principles and applications of AI through a technical lens that emphasizes the mastery of AI principles, the mathematical foundations underlying these technologies, and the programming and mathematical skills necessary to implement AI solutions. In AI Literacy for All, we emphasize a balanced curriculum that includes technical and non-technical learning outcomes to enable a conceptual understanding and critical evaluation of AI technologies in an interdisciplinary socio-technical context. The paper presents four pillars of AI literacy: understanding the scope and technical dimensions of AI, learning how to interact with Gen-AI in an informed and responsible way, the socio-technical issues of ethical and responsible AI, and the social and future implications of AI. While it is important to include all learning outcomes for AI education in a Computer Science major, the learning outcomes can be adjusted for other learning contexts, including, non-CS majors, high school summer camps, the adult workforce, and the public.

The proliferation and adoption of artificial intelligence (AI) by educational institutions have demonstrated promising potential to support instructional activities across many disciplines, including CT education. However, a comprehensive overview outlining the various aspects of integrating AI in CT education in higher education is lacking. To mitigate this gap, we conducted this systematic literature review study. The focus of our study is to identify initiatives applying AI in CT education within higher education and to explore various educational aspects of these initiatives, including the benefits and challenges of AI in CT education, instructional strategies employed, CT components covered, and AI techniques and models utilized. This study provides practical and scientific contributions to the CT education community, including an inventory of AI-based initiatives for CT education useful to educators, an overview of various aspects of integrating AI into CT education such as its benefits and challenges (e.g., AI potential to reshape CT education versus its potential to diminish students creativity) and insights into new and expanded perspectives on CT in light of AI (e.g., the decoding approach alongside the coding approach to CT).",10.1145/3724389.3730775,2025,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.09677v1,arXiv

Visions of a Discipline: Analyzing Introductory AI Courses on YouTube,"Severin Engelmann, Madiha Zahrah Choksi, Angelina Wang, Casey Fiesler","Education plays an indispensable role in fostering societal well-being and is widely regarded as one of the most influential factors in shaping the future of generations to come. As artificial intelligence (AI) becomes more deeply integrated into our daily lives and the workforce, educational institutions at all levels are directing their focus on resources that cater to AI education. Our work investigates the current landscape of introductory AI courses on YouTube, and the potential for introducing ethics in this context. We qualitatively analyze the 20 most watched introductory AI courses on YouTube, coding a total of 92.2 hours of educational content viewed by close to 50 million people. Introductory AI courses do not meaningfully engage with ethical or societal challenges of AI (RQ1). When \textit{defining and framing AI}, introductory AI courses foreground excitement around AI's transformative role in society, over-exaggerate AI's current and future abilities, and anthropomorphize AI (RQ2). In \textit{teaching AI}, we see a widespread reliance on corporate AI tools and frameworks as well as a prioritization on a hands-on approach to learning rather than on conceptual foundations (RQ3). In promoting key \textit{AI practices}, introductory AI courses abstract away entirely the socio-technical nature of AI classification and prediction, for example by favoring data quantity over data quality (RQ4). We extend our analysis with recommendations that aim to integrate ethical reflections into introductory AI courses. We recommend that introductory AI courses should (1) highlight ethical challenges of AI to present a more balanced perspective, (2) raise ethical issues explicitly relevant to the technical concepts discussed and (3) nurture a sense of accountability in future AI developers.",,2024,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2407.13077v1,arXiv

Adapting to Educate: Conversational AI's Role in Mathematics Education   Across Different Educational Contexts,"Alex Liu, Lief Esbenshade, Min Sun, Shawon Sarkar, Jian He, Victor Tian, Zachary Zhang","As educational settings increasingly integrate artificial intelligence (AI), understanding how AI tools identify -- and adapt their responses to -- varied educational contexts becomes paramount. This study examines conversational AI's effectiveness in supporting K-12 mathematics education across various educational contexts. Through qualitative content analysis, we identify educational contexts and key instructional needs present in educator prompts and assess AI's responsiveness. Our findings indicate that educators focus their AI conversations on assessment methods, how to set the cognitive demand level of their instruction, and strategies for making meaningful real-world connections. However, educators' conversations with AI about instructional practices do vary across revealed educational contexts; they shift their emphasis to tailored, rigorous content that addresses their students' unique needs. Educators often seek actionable guidance from AI and reject responses that do not align with their inquiries. While AI can provide accurate, relevant, and useful information when educational contexts or instructional practices are specified in conversation queries, its ability to consistently adapt responses along these evaluation dimensions varies across different educational settings. Significant work remains to realize the response-differentiating potential of conversational AI tools in complex educational use cases. This research contributes insights into developing AI tools that are responsive, proactive, and anticipatory, adapting to evolving educational needs before they are explicitly stated, and provides actionable recommendations for both developers and educators to enhance AI integration in educational practices.",,2025,arXiv: cs.HC,http://arxiv.org/abs/2503.02999v1,arXiv

"The Interplay of Learning, Analytics, and Artificial Intelligence in   Education: A Vision for Hybrid Intelligence",Mutlu Cukurova,"This paper presents a multi-dimensional view of AI's role in learning and education, emphasizing the intricate interplay between AI, analytics, and the learning processes. Here, I challenge the prevalent narrow conceptualisation of AI as tools, as exemplified in generative AI tools, and argue for the importance of alternative conceptualisations of AI for achieving human-AI hybrid intelligence. I highlight the differences between human intelligence and artificial information processing, the importance of hybrid human-AI systems to extend human cognition, and posit that AI can also serve as an instrument for understanding human learning. Early learning sciences and AI in Education research (AIED), which saw AI as an analogy for human intelligence, have diverged from this perspective, prompting a need to rekindle this connection. The paper presents three unique conceptualisations of AI: the externalization of human cognition, the internalization of AI models to influence human mental models, and the extension of human cognition via tightly coupled human-AI hybrid intelligence systems. Examples from current research and practice are examined as instances of the three conceptualisations in education, highlighting the potential value and limitations of each conceptualisation for education, as well as the perils of overemphasis on externalising human cognition. The paper concludes with advocacy for a broader approach to AIED that goes beyond considerations on the design and development of AI, but also includes educating people about AI and innovating educational systems to remain relevant in an AI-ubiquitous world.",,2024,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.16081v4,arXiv

However, the adoption of these technologies has raised concerns about their impact on academic integrity, students' ability to problem-solve independently, and potential underlying biases. To better understand students' perspectives and experiences with these tools, a survey was conducted at a large public university in the United States. Through thematic analysis, 262 undergraduate students' responses regarding their perceived benefits and risks of AI chatbots in education were identified and categorized into themes.   The results discuss several benefits identified by the students, with feedback and study support, instruction capabilities, and access to information being the most cited. Their primary concerns included risks to academic integrity, accuracy of information, loss of critical thinking skills, the potential development of overreliance, and ethical considerations such as data privacy, system bias, environmental impact, and preservation of human elements in education.   While student perceptions align with previously discussed benefits and risks of AI in education, they show heightened concerns about distinguishing between human and AI generated work - particularly in cases where authentic work is flagged as AI-generated. To address students' concerns, institutions can establish clear policies regarding AI use and develop curriculum around AI literacy.
