"Generative AI in Education: A Study of Educators' Awareness, Sentiments,   and Influencing Factors","Aashish Ghimire, James Prather, John Edwards","The rapid advancement of artificial intelligence (AI) and the expanding integration of large language models (LLMs) have ignited a debate about their application in education. This study delves into university instructors' experiences and attitudes toward AI language models, filling a gap in the literature by analyzing educators' perspectives on AI's role in the classroom and its potential impacts on teaching and learning. The objective of this research is to investigate the level of awareness, overall sentiment towardsadoption, and the factors influencing these attitudes for LLMs and generative AI-based tools in higher education. Data was collected through a survey using a Likert scale, which was complemented by follow-up interviews to gain a more nuanced understanding of the instructors' viewpoints. The collected data was processed using statistical and thematic analysis techniques. Our findings reveal that educators are increasingly aware of and generally positive towards these tools. We find no correlation between teaching style and attitude toward generative AI. Finally, while CS educators show far more confidence in their technical understanding of generative AI tools and more positivity towards them than educators in other fields, they show no more confidence in their ability to detect AI-generated work.",,2024,arXiv: cs.AI,http://arxiv.org/abs/2403.15586v1,,arXiv

Generative AI in Higher Education: Evidence from an Elite College,"Zara Contractor, Germán Reyes","Generative AI is transforming higher education, yet systematic evidence on student adoption remains limited. Using novel survey data from a selective U.S. college, we document over 80 percent of students using AI academically within two years of ChatGPT's release. Adoption varies across disciplines, demographics, and achievement levels, highlighting AI's potential to reshape educational inequalities. Students predominantly use AI for augmenting learning (e.g., explanations, feedback), but also to automate tasks (e.g., essay generation). Positive perceptions of AI's educational benefits strongly predict adoption. Institutional policies can influence usage patterns but risk creating unintended disparate impacts across student groups due to uneven compliance.",,2025,"arXiv: econ.GN, q-fin.EC",http://arxiv.org/abs/2508.00717v1,,arXiv
The Impact of Generative AI on Student Churn and the Future of Formal   Education,Stephen Elbourn,"In the contemporary educational landscape, the advent of Generative Artificial Intelligence (AI) presents unprecedented opportunities for personalised learning, fundamentally challenging the traditional paradigms of education. This research explores the emerging trend where high school students, empowered by tailored educational experiences provided by Generative AI, opt to forgo traditional university degrees to pursue entrepreneurial ventures at a younger age. To understand and predict the future of education in the age of Generative AI, we employ a comprehensive methodology to analyse social media data. Our approach includes sentiment analysis to gauge public opinion, topic modelling to identify key themes and emerging trends, and user demographic analysis to understand the engagement of different age groups and regions. We also perform influencer analysis to identify key figures shaping the discourse and engagement metrics to measure the level of interest and interaction with AI-related educational content. Content analysis helps us to determine the types of content being shared and the prevalent narratives, while hashtag analysis reveals the connectivity of discussions. The temporal analysis tracks changes over time and identifies event-based spikes in discussions. The insights derived from this analysis include the acceptance and adoption of Generative AI in education, its impact on traditional education models, the influence on students' entrepreneurial ambitions, and the educational outcomes associated with AI-driven personalised learning. Additionally, we explore public sentiment towards policies and regulations and use predictive modelling to forecast future trends. This comprehensive social media analysis provides a nuanced understanding of the evolving educational landscape, offering valuable perspectives on the role of Generative AI in shaping the future of education.",,2024,arXiv: cs.IR,http://arxiv.org/abs/2412.00605v1,,arXiv
Integrating Generative AI into LMS: Reshaping Learning and Instructional   Design,"Xinran Zhu, Liam Magee, Peg Mischler","Education in the era of generative AI faces a pivotal transformation. As AI systems reshape professional practices-from software development to creative design-educators must reconsider how to prepare students for a future where humans and machines co-construct knowledge. While tools like ChatGPT and Claude automate tasks and personalize learning, their educational potential depends on how meaningfully they are integrated into learning environments. This paper argues that Learning Management Systems (LMSs), as the core of educational practice, must evolve from static content repositories into dynamic ecosystems that cultivate higher-order thinking and meaningful human-AI interaction. We propose two guiding principles for integrating generative AI into LMSs. First, From Content Delivery to Fostering Higher-Order Thinking, emphasizing AI's role in supporting inquiry, collaboration, and reflective knowledge building. Second, Toward Meaningful Interaction with AI, highlighting the design of learning environments that nurture critical, intentional, and socially mediated engagement with AI. Drawing on a case study of CheckIT Learning, we illustrate how these principles can translate into practice. We conclude with the need for Edtech partnerships in an AI-powered world, underscoring that responsible AI integration in education requires sustained collaboration among researchers, educators, and technologists to ensure ethical, pedagogically grounded, and cognitively informed innovation.",,2025,arXiv: cs.CY,http://arxiv.org/abs/2510.18026v1,,arXiv

Beyond Tools: Generative AI as Epistemic Infrastructure in Education,Bodong Chen,"As generative AI rapidly integrates into educational infrastructures worldwide, it transforms how knowledge gets created, validated, and shared, yet current discourse inadequately addresses its implications as epistemic infrastructure mediating teaching and learning. This paper investigates how AI systems function as epistemic infrastructures in education and their impact on human epistemic agency. Adopting a situated cognition perspective and following a value-sensitive design approach, the study conducts a technical investigation of two representative AI systems in educational settings, analyzing their impact on teacher practice across three dimensions: affordances for skilled epistemic actions, support for epistemic sensitivity, and implications for long-term habit formation. The analysis reveals that current AI systems inadequately support teachers' skilled epistemic actions, insufficiently foster epistemic sensitivity, and potentially cultivate problematic habits that prioritize efficiency over epistemic agency. To address these challenges, the paper recommends recognizing the infrastructural transformation occurring in education, developing AI environments that stimulate skilled actions while upholding epistemic norms, and involving educators in AI design processes -- recommendations aimed at fostering AI integration that aligns with core educational values and maintains human epistemic agency.",,2025,"arXiv: cs.CY, cs.AI",http://arxiv.org/abs/2504.06928v1,,arXiv
