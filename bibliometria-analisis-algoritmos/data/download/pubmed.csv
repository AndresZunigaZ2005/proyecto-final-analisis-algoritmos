Cannabis Use Patterns Among Adults Living With Chronic Pain Before and During the COVID Pandemic: Insights From the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Study,"Amrit Baral, Denise C. Vidot, Bria-Necole A. Diggs, Isabella Jimenez, Varan Govind, Eva Widerstrom-Noga, Michelle Weiner, Johis Ortega, Marvin Reid, Jacqueline Sagen","Background This study aims to identify sociodemographic factors associated with cannabis use for chronic pain management before and after COVID-19 was declared a pandemic. Furthermore, it seeks to compare cannabis use patterns in adults with and without chronic pain. Methods We analyzed US-based responses from the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Study, a cross-sectional online survey administered via REDCap between March 2020 and March 2022. All respondents were cannabis consumers in the past year. Cannabis use patterns and chronic pain were self-reported via the COVID-19 Cannabis Health Questionnaire. Statistical analysis included Chi-square tests, Fisher's exact tests,  t -tests, and multivariable logistic regression with a two-tailed alpha of 0.05 for significance. Results Among 2243 participants, 50.3% consumed cannabis to manage chronic pain. Younger age (< 40 years; aOR: 3.20, 95% CI: 2.59–3.96), Hispanic/Latino ethnicity (aOR: 2.20, 95% CI: 1.56–3.05), and higher income levels (> $100,000 annually; aOR: 1.69, 95% CI: 1.25–2.29) were associated with higher odds of consuming cannabis to manage chronic pain. Participants using cannabis for chronic pain were more likely to use a CBD/THC ratio. The pandemic led to increased dosages and changes in consumption methods: 40.5% increased their cannabis dose, smoking as the primary method declined from 62.2% before the pandemic to 34.5% afterward, while edibles rose from 7.9% to 30.9%, and tinctures from 3.2% to 8.6%. Route changes varied with chronic pain status. Conclusion There was a shift from smoking to nonsmoking methods to manage chronic pain. Those who were younger and those of Hispanic/Latino ethnicity had higher odds of using cannabis for chronic pain.",10.1155/prm/9631487,2025,Pain Research & Management,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12575038/,United States,PubMed
Balancing Innovation and Control: The European Union AI Act in an Era of Global Uncertainty,"Elena Giovanna Bignami, Michele Russo, Federico Semeraro, Valentina Bellini","Abstract The European Union's Artificial Intelligence Act (EU AI Act), adopted in 2024, establishes a landmark regulatory framework for artificial intelligence (AI) systems, with significant implications for health care. The Act classifies medical AI as ""high-risk,"" imposing stringent requirements for transparency, data governance, and human oversight. While these measures aim to safeguard patient safety, they may also hinder innovation, particularly for smaller health care providers and startups. Concurrently, geopolitical instability—marked by rising military expenditures, trade tensions, and supply chain disruptions—threatens health care innovation and access. This paper examines the challenges and opportunities posed by the AI Act in health care within a volatile geopolitical landscape. It evaluates the intersection of Europe's regulatory approach with competing priorities, including technological sovereignty, ethical AI, and equitable health care, while addressing unintended consequences such as reduced innovation and supply chain vulnerabilities. The study employs a comprehensive review of the EU AI Act's provisions, geopolitical trends, and their implications for health care. It analyzes regulatory documents, stakeholder statements, and case studies to assess compliance burdens, innovation barriers, and geopolitical risks. The paper also synthesizes recommendations from multidisciplinary experts to propose actionable solutions. Key findings include: (1) the AI Act's high-risk classification for medical AI could improve patient safety but risks stifling innovation due to compliance costs (eg, €29,277 annually per AI unit) and certification burdens (€16,800-23,000 per unit); (2) geopolitical factors—such as United States-China semiconductor tariffs and EU rearmament—exacerbate supply chain vulnerabilities and divert funding from health care innovation; (3) the dominance of ""superstar"" firms in AI development may marginalize smaller players, further concentrating innovation in well-resourced organizations; and (4) regulatory sandboxes, AI literacy programs, and international collaboration emerge as viable strategies to balance innovation and compliance. The EU AI Act provides a critical framework for ethical AI in health care, but its success depends on mitigating regulatory burdens and geopolitical risks. Proactive measures—such as multidisciplinary task forces, resilient supply chains, and human-augmented AI systems—are essential to foster innovation while ensuring patient safety. Policymakers, clinicians, and technologists must collaborate to navigate these challenges in an era of global uncertainty.",10.2196/75527,2025,JMIR AI,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574960/,Italy,PubMed
Development and validation of a nutritional literacy assessment scale for nasopharyngeal carcinoma patients undergoing concurrent chemoradiotherapy,"Zhang Yanxin, Huang Xiaojun, Yang Guirong, Li Wei, Liang Limin, Wei Lina, Lu Jiamei","Background Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a head and neck malignancy highly prevalent in East and Southeast Asia, for which concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) is the standard treatment option. However, the superimposed effects of radiotherapy (especially head and neck radiotherapy) and chemotherapy often lead to severe acute toxic reactions, insufficient nutritional knowledge of patients, and dietary misconceptions all affect the patient’s ability to eat and their nutritional status. Therefore, there is an urgent need to develop a Nutritional Literacy Scale (NLS) for patients undergoing simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) to optimize the overall nutritional management of NPC patients and to improve the therapeutic effect. Methods The first draft of the scale was formed through literature analysis, semi-structured interviews, and expert correspondence. From April 2024 to December 2024, 245 patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with simultaneous radiotherapy and chemotherapy in the radiotherapy department of the First Affiliated Hospital of Guangxi Medical University were collected as the study subjects, and the scale was subjected to item analysis and reliability and validity tests, and the questionnaire was administered again to the patients 2 weeks later to measure the re-test reliability of the scale. Results The Nutritional Literacy Scale for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma Patients Undergoing Simultaneous Radiotherapy included 4 dimensions and 30 entries. Exploratory factor analysis extracted four male factors with a cumulative variance contribution of 62.3%; validated factor analysis showed that χ 2 /df = 1.155 ( p  = 0.085), GFI = 0.928, RMSEA = 0.025, CFI = 0.994, NFI = 0.956, and IFI = 0.994; questionnaire content validity I-CVI was 0.872 to 1.000, S-CVI was 0.932; Cronbach’s alpha coefficient for the total scale was 0.849, folded reliability was 0.869, and retest reliability was 0.960. Conclusion The Nutritional Literacy Scale for Nasopharyngeal Cancer Patients Undergoing Simultaneous Radiotherapy has good reliability and validity.",10.3389/fnut.2025.1589233,2025,Frontiers in Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574708/,China,PubMed
Residential Socio‐Demographic Scoring and Child Growth,"Ornit Cohen, Natalya Bilenko, Eytan Israel, Sharon Daniel","ABSTRACT Background While individual socioeconomic attributes have been widely studied in relation to child growth, the associations with broader, area‐level socio‐demographic characteristics of residential areas have not been thoroughly assessed. Objectives To examine the associations between area‐level socio‐demographic features of small residential areas and child growth trajectories. Methods We conducted a population‐based retrospective cohort study, including all children born in Israel from 2004 to 2018, who underwent postnatal follow‐up in the Mother and Child Health Clinics (MCHC) of the Ministry of Health. The MCHC network covers a significant proportion of the Israeli paediatric population, providing vaccination and developmental assessments to children up to 6 years old. Socio‐demographic scoring was retrieved from the Israel Bureau of Statistics' geographical unit grading system, established for 990 rural areas and 1629 micro‐geographical areas in 81 cities, using various population measurements. Height‐for‐age (HAZ) and weight‐for‐age (WAZ)  z ‐scores were calculated using data from MCHC visits at birth and specific intervals. Results A total of 1,485,198 children were included (51.3% male). The mean birthweight and length were 3210 ± 52.2 g ( z  = −0.22) and 49.4 ± 3.33 cm ( z  = −0.06), respectively. Children resided in low (47%), intermediate (24.4%) and high (28.5%) socioeconomic areas. Throughout follow‐up, children from low SES areas had consistently lower HAZ and WAZ scores across all birthweight groups, particularly among those with normal and high birthweight. In linear mixed‐effects models, birth HAZ and WAZ scores were higher in high vs. low SES areas ( β  = 0.3 and  β  = 0.1, respectively), with non‐linear growth trajectories characterised by early advantages in higher SES groups, a plateau in mid‐childhood and renewed growth acceleration later in childhood. Conclusions The study provides evidence of impaired child growth in lower socio‐demographic areas. This underscores the importance of identifying areas based on global attributes to identify regions predisposed to child growth impairment, particularly in developed nations.",10.1111/ppe.70053,2025,Paediatric and Perinatal Epidemiology,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574495/,Israel,PubMed
Advances and challenges in nutritional screening and assessment for cancer patients: a comprehensive systematic review and future directions,"Luocheng Zhang, Zibo Ding, Yanfei Zhao, Ziyao Cheng, Jiahao Hu, Lanqing Huo","Introduction Cancer-associated malnutrition is a pervasive and under-recognized complication that profoundly impacts treatment tolerance, clinical outcomes, and quality of life. Despite the availability of multiple nutritional screening and assessment tools, these instruments differ widely in sensitivity, specificity, and ease of integration into clinical workflows, and no universally accepted standard exists. This review critically examines the current landscape of malnutrition assessment in oncology, summarizes tool performance across populations and cancer types, and proposes strategies—such as artificial intelligence–enabled models and internationally harmonized protocols—to improve diagnosis, treatment planning, and overall patient outcomes. Methods A comprehensive literature search was conducted across PubMed, Web of Science, Embase, and Elsevier databases, covering studies published up to 13 March 2025. Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) were used to identify terms including “malnutrition,” “cachexia,” “cancer,” “nutritional status assessment,” “nutritional screening,” and “nutritional screening tool.” Boolean operators refined the strategy, and a two-stage screening excluded studies with irrelevant populations, outcomes, or designs, as well as non-peer-reviewed sources. Results Significant heterogeneity was found in tool performance and applicability across cancer types, clinical settings, and demographic subgroups. General instruments such as the Malnutrition Universal Screening Tool (MUST) and Nutritional Risk Screening 2002 (NRS-2002) demonstrated strong predictive validity in broad clinical use, whereas condition-specific tools like Patient-Generated Subjective Global Assessment (PG-SGA) offered superior sensitivity in high-risk populations, including patients with gastric or head and neck cancers. However, variability in thresholds, assessment frequency, and validation approaches highlights the urgent need for standardization. Discussion Current assessment strategies are limited by subjectivity, static single-point evaluations, and inconsistent implementation. Future innovations should integrate artificial intelligence, dynamic longitudinal monitoring, and multimodal data analytics to develop objective and personalized evaluation systems. Establishing globally harmonized standards will be crucial to improving nutritional care, reducing malnutrition-related morbidity, and enhancing survival and quality of life for patients with cancer.",10.3389/fnut.2025.1688344,2025,Frontiers in Nutrition,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574454/,China,PubMed
"Gender, self-care and toxic exposures: a narrative review of personal care product use and health equity implications","Eleni Prifti, Austen El-Osta","Abstract Background Personal care products (PCPs) are widely used across populations, yet their composition includes a range of hazardous chemicals that pose risks to human health and the environment. Emerging evidence highlights how PCP-related exposures are not evenly distributed, but shaped by intersecting forces of gender, race and social inequality. Despite being framed as tools for empowerment and wellness, PCPs may contribute to disproportionate toxic exposures, particularly for women and girls. Objective This narrative review critically examines the environmental health implications of gendered self-care practices through the lens of PCP use. It synthesises current evidence on chemical exposures, identifies high-risk subgroups, explores mechanisms of harm and outlines implications for regulation, clinical practice and environmental health literacy. Methods Drawing on interdisciplinary peer-reviewed literature published between 2000 and 2025, the review focuses on endocrine-disrupting chemicals, perfluoroalkyl and polyfluoroalkyl substances, volatile organic compounds, heavy metals and microparticles and nanoparticles commonly found in PCPs. Particular attention is given to vulnerable populations, including beauty salon workers, pregnant individuals, adolescents, women of colour and infants. Findings PCP use results in chronic low-level exposure to multiple hazardous compounds via dermal, inhalation and mucosal routes. These exposures have been linked to adverse reproductive, developmental and metabolic outcomes, increasing the risks of non-communicable diseases like cancer and obesity and possibly affecting infertility rates. Early evidence shows that interventions such as product substitution can yield rapid reductions in internal toxicant levels. However, individual behaviour change alone is insufficient to address systemic disparities in exposure risk. Conclusions Self-care must be reframed as a public health and environmental justice issue. Stronger regulatory oversight, clinician education and population-level environmental health literacy are urgently needed to reduce harmful exposures. Equitable self-care should prioritise not only personal choice, but also structural accountability and collective safety.",10.1136/bmjph-2025-003564,2025,BMJ Public Health,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574390/,Greece,PubMed
Mapping current research on biomarkers associated with the diagnosis of pedophilia: a scoping review,"Maria Karanikola, Anna T. El Riz, Andreas Chatzittofis","Background Pedophilia remains a challenging area of study due to its sensitive nature and the ethical considerations surrounding research involving individuals with deviant sexual interests. Objective The aim of this review was to systematically explore and present the current research status on biomarkers in pedophilia. The focus was on biomarkers that may support the diagnostic process, treatment evaluation and assessment of risk and recidivism of pedophilia. Methods Based on literature searches [MEDLINE, EMBASE, Scopus, APA PsycNet, Google Scholar], a scoping review was applied between January and March 2024, including studies in adults diagnosed with pedophilia, published within the last decade. Results A total of 39 studies were included in the study sample. These encompassed only male participants. Biomarkers associated with pedophilia were identified and categorized as following: genetic/epigenetic and neuroendocrinal, physiological, cognitive/behavioral, and neuroimaging/neurofunctional. Results indicated the presence of cognitive deficits or impairments, especially in memory and executive functions, significant structural and functional brain differences in neuroimaging, with evidence of altered connectivity, volume reductions, and abnormal brain activation patterns. Physiological biomarkers revealed altered physical traits, attentional control, and sexual arousal patterns in pedophilia, with neural responses suggesting dysfunction in prefrontal cortex and error processing areas. Lastly, genetic and neuroendocrine studies suggested a potential link between epigenetic alterations in the serotonergic and testosterone systems, with lower testosterone levels and signs of prenatal androgen exposure observed in pedophilic individuals. Conclusions This review mapped the existing state of the art data in biomarkers in pedophilia, also supporting the existence of promising biological systems implicated in the pathophysiology of pedophilia, thus emphasized the need for further research in the field.

Ethical challenges in the algorithmic era: a systematic rapid review of risk insights and governance pathways for nursing predictive analytics and early warning systems,"Yucheng Cao, Lili Deng, Xusheng Liu, Zhixian Feng, Yu Gao","Background Predictive analytics and early warning systems are now widely used in nursing practice worldwide. While these tools can improve efficiency and patient safety, but at the same time posing ethical challenges related to data privacy, algorithmic fairness, accountability, professional autonomy, and patient rights. Through a systematic rapid review, we identify the major ethical risks in nursing contexts and propose actionable governance pathways to inform clinical practice and policy. Methods This study used a systematic rapid review, searching eight databases—PubMed, Embase, Web of Science, Scopus, Cochrane Library, Ovid, EBSCOhost, and ProQuest—for English-language articles published from 2015 through May 2025. Two reviewers independently screened records and extracted data, with a third reviewer resolving disagreements, yielding 22 included studies. Using inductive thematic analysis, we summarized the ethical-risk dimensions and governance pathways of predictive analytics and early warning systems in nursing practice, and conducted an overall quality appraisal of the included literature. Results The included studies came from 11 countries, with publication volume rising markedly in recent years—reflecting growing attention to ethical issues in nursing. Most were reviews or commentaries, with fewer qualitative and mixed-methods studies. Thematic analysis identified five ethical-risk dimensions: (i) Data- and Algorithm-Related Ethical Risks; (ii) Professional Role and Responsibility Attribution Risks; (iii) Patient Rights and Humane-Care Ethical Risks; (iv) Ethical-Governance and Misuse Risks; and (v) Technological Accessibility and Social Acceptance Barriers. In response, the literature proposes four governance pathways—Technical–Data Governance, Clinical Human–Machine Collaboration, Organizational-Capacity Building, and Institutional–Policy Regulation—with concrete measures including privacy protection, algorithmic-bias monitoring and fairness audits, transparency and explainability enhancement, nurse training and digital literacy, interdisciplinary collaboration and co-creation, and policy and regulatory guidelines. Conclusions Predictive analytics and early warning systems in nursing practice show substantial promise yet are accompanied by multidimensional ethical risks. For the first time in a nursing context, this study proposes a “five ethical-risk dimensions–four governance pathways” framework, offering actionable ethical-governance guidance for nurses, administrators, and policymakers. Future work should pursue interdisciplinary, multicenter empirical studies to evaluate the framework’s feasibility and effectiveness and to align technological benefits with ethical values, thereby improving nursing quality and patient safety.

"Two Orders of Magnitude Reduction in Computational
Load Achieved by Ultrawideband Responses of an Ion-Gating Reservoir","Daiki Nishioka, Hina Kitano, Wataru Namiki, Satofumi Souma, Kazuya Terabe, Takashi Tsuchiya","The rising energy demands of conventional AI systems underscore
the need for efficient computing technologies, such as brain-inspired
computing. Physical reservoir computing (PRC), leveraging the nonlinear
dynamics of physical systems for information processing, has emerged
as a promising approach for neuromorphic computing. However, current
PRC systems are constrained by narrow responsive time scales and limited
performance. To address these challenges, an ion-gel/graphene electric
double layer (EDL) transistor-based ion-gating reservoir (IGR) was
developed. This IGR achieves a highly tunable and ultrawide time-scale
response through the coexistence of fast EDL dynamics at the ion-gel/graphene
interface and slower molecular adsorption dynamics on the graphene
surface. Consequently, the system demonstrates an exceptionally broad
responsive range, from 1 MHz to 20 Hz, while maintaining a high information
processing capacity and adaptability across multiple time scales.
The IGR achieved deep learning (DL)-level accuracy in chaotic time
series prediction tasks while reducing computational resource requirements
to 1/100 of those needed by DL. Principal component analysis reveals
the IGR’s superior performance stems from its high-dimensionality,
driven by the ultrawideband responses of the EDL along with the ambipolar
behavior of graphene. The proposed IGR represents a significant step
forward in providing low-power, high-performance computing solutions,
particularly for resource-constrained edge environments.",10.1021/acsnano.5c06174,2025,ACS Nano,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574214/,United Kingdom,PubMed
Mevalonate kinase deficiency (hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome) in a Tanzanian girl: a case report,"Elisamia Ngowi, Rukhsar Osman, Hajaj Mohamed Salum, Maria Bulimba, Evance Godfrey, Aika Abia Shoo, Nahida Z. Walli, Mohamedraza Ebrahim, Mariam Noorani, Peter M. Swai, Francis F. Furia","Background Hyperimmunoglobulin D syndrome is a rare autosomal recessive autoinflammatory syndrome caused by mevalonate kinase enzyme deficiency. It is characterized by recurrent febrile attacks beginning in the first year of life. Treatment is mainly supportive, and there are successful reports of trials of novel therapies such as anakinra and canakinumab. Case presentation We present a case of a 3-month-old girl from Tanzania, East Africa, who experienced recurrent febrile attacks, sepsis, and anemia since her first week of life. She also exhibited arthritis, generalized lymphadenopathy, urticaria, dermatitis, and failure to thrive. After multiple hospital admissions for similar symptoms, a diagnosis of primary immunodeficiency was considered and genetic testing revealed two heterozygous-like pathogenic variants in the mevalonate kinase gene. Conclusion This case highlights the importance of clinicians in low-resource settings to have a high index of suspicion for primary immunodeficiencies when managing patients with recurrent febrile infections and to consider genetic studies for accurate diagnosis.",10.1186/s13256-025-05637-w,2025,Journal of Medical Case Reports,https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC12574009/,,PubMed
